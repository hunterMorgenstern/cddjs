// they are  given sections where are those?`
topics:
does anybody have any thoughts about the economy or taxes or anything in this section?

gary: thinks the issue is a complicated tax code and that people abuse welfare  programs, he references anecdotes for both,
    tells a story about talking to an accountant and another about people abusing disability coming in to his motorcycle shop,
will: agrees taxes are complicated and should be simplified, maybe in to a one page argument
    he explains he works part time in taxes and points to a law that enacted a tax at a specific date as evidence
gary: agrees and is curious if the wealthy can accurately put what they make
will: thinks thats easy because everyone gets a w2 at the end of the year
gary: responds only if you have wages
will: responds yeah well ceos make a ton of money
nancy: their wealth is often much greater than salary
will: thought it was any taxes, realizes they're only debating a wealth tax,
nancy: says its not just wages they make income in different ways,
will: thinks that still should be easy enough to track
// gpt produced, lacks gary and  wills explanations from above and missed erickss 
Nancy: explains that the wealthy have a lot of different types of income that are taxed separately, and that it's more difficult to accurately tax their income than it is for the average person.
Will: agrees that it's difficult to tax wealth, and that it's hard to determine how much money someone has made.
Nancy: explains that Elizabeth Warren has proposed a 2% tax on income over 2 million dollars, which she feels is a fair way to tax the wealthy.
Gary: explains that a farmer who owns a 300 acre farm may have a lot of wealth, but may not have a lot of income, and that taxing his income would be unfair.
Nancy: explains that the tax would only be on income, not on wealth.
Angela: points out that it is easy to say that everyone should pay taxes, but it is harder to actually make that happen.
Nori: explains that one weakness of the US tax system is that there are a large percentage of citizens who pay no taxes.
Nancy: explains that people who are in poverty are not "takers" and that they work hard to make ends meet.
Will: agrees that there are people who abuse the system, but points out that there are ways to prevent that from happening.
