Speaker,Time,Text
Moderator,13:15:00-14:48:00," there are five proposals for our discussion on fossil fuel use. they are focused on whether and when to stop using certain types of fossil fuels. first, the us should eliminate ghg emissions from coal as soon as possible, ideally by 2035. second, the us should eliminate ghg emissions from oil and natural gas, as soon as possible, ideally by 2050. third, the us should eliminate the use of fossil fuels in generation of electricity as soon as possible. fourth, the us should eliminate the use of fossil fuels in cement, steel production as soon as new technologies permit. and, fifth, the use of some fossil fuels should be allowed beyond a transition to net zero for the production of pharmaceuticals, plastics, agricultural chemicals and other products that currently can only be produced from fossil fuels. to see more about these proposals and the pros and cons, please click view details in the agenda. now, what do you think about fossil fuel use? please share your thoughts whether in support or opposition."
steviek6,14:48:00-15:33:00," so i'll start off by saying that i think that the use of fossil fuels has gotten us from the 20th, in the 19th century through the 20th century now to the 21st century. okay, and and maybe it's time to realize that all of that buildup of carbon in the environment is causing some of the issues that we're seeing today in globe, as far as weather is concerned. so, so i think that yeah, it's time to stop. it's time to get people on board with this and it's time to bring together the world and see if everyone agrees. but i think people are agreeing. i think that the movement is in this direction for sure."
Francis,15:33:00-15:59:00," i definitely like the idea of phasing fossil fuels out and stuff like that. i don't think that it is something that can happen overnight. so i like the idea that they have timelines and place. i feel like a certain type of compromise is needed in certain areas, but with the idea of progressing and moving forward, i think it's all a good idea."
Adam M,15:59:00-16:42:00," i think we're about 40 years too late to avoid the worst of what's going to happen. and you know, every year that we passed without action is just another nail in the coffin. so i think that there's nothing too drastic. i think we should take the most drastic action possible because we got to think about okay, what are the costs of non-action? our lives are going to change dramatically, no matter what we do. so we either have to except our lives changing because of climate change or accept our lives changing, because we're trying to do something about climate change."
Laura,16:42:00-17:16:00," i totally agree with what adam just said, you know, we either change because of climate change or we change to try to avoid climate change. so that would be, that would be preferable. but i think specifically the proposal about eliminating coal by 2035. i think that's super attainable because coal is such a small share of our current electricity and heat source. so, and it's also the dirtiest burning. so, it just seems really logical to get rid of that one first."
Wendi,17:16:00-17:43:00," i angry with, with all of you that it does need to happen, especially with the cold, but how can it happen without devastating the economy? especially you have your lower class people that are not going to be able to make the changes? how do you incorporate that?"
Amanda,17:43:00-18:28:00," yeah, i agree that it is kind of starting to be too late. i, you know, growing up in the 90s. we were constantly being told save the planet plant trees. make a change and seeing it now that you know, you know, in 2021 that we still have people resisting this. it's kind of depressing, you know, because we do we do need to save what we have left and i didn't even know that, you know, like cement plants. i mean, obviously they do cause a lot of pollution."
Nestor Flores,18:28:00-19:11:00," yeah, i agree with the previous speakers. going away from these fossil fuels is you need to do it as soon as possible. and of course, like before there are like lots of low-income jobs around around coal, for example, but i feel that these jobs can eventually be replaced with the introduction of renewable resources, like solar and wind. our planet is is constantly getting worse and worse. like, i know in houston with hurricanes constantly battery in our city. it's just it's getting crazy."
Tarenlynn,19:11:00-19:56:00," yeah, so my suggestion would just be, why don't we take the trillions of dollars? we spend, on our defense budget to help anybody, that would be affected by the offset of using natural, you know, fossil fuels or whatever. and, you know, we're a world that's just where consumers and we just, we cannot get enough and china would be consuming from china on amazon and i don't think we've really think about all of that, all the plastics for using and throw away stuff. and so the money is there to help the people that might be upset. it's just me. need there needs to be a change."
Todd,19:56:00-20:41:00," i just know what like, what the fossil fuels, we got possibly with the sun, the wind, but what doesn't make sense is how good things for us? always cost more, like we got the win, we got the song, but it seems like we don't put the money to the side. that's going to help improve our planet. but if we do, it's going to cost more like, everybody's like a money grab and that doesn't make sense where we can better our world and we would actually help. hope it out, change something different, but it just doesn't make sense. why everything that's going to be better for us. it costs more."
steviek6,20:41:00-21:17:00," well, i think the thing also, that's interesting that's going on. is that the politicians? aren't really part of the process here. some of them are and they're ridiculed. they're called tree huggers or you know, the green new deal and all that. so i think we need to stop calling each other names in the big picture and the political picture. and i think we as individuals need to see the whole picture of that. we have to change things in the social. milieu. we have to get people to start thinking together, saying this is the best for humankind for humanity."
Laura,21:17:00-21:58:00," the only concern that i have with shifting to more renewable technologies, is that as we're scaling up, the renewable technologies, were going to need to manufacture more of them obviously. and a lot of them are really dependent on precious metals, that were importing from other countries and that are limited. just like fossil fuels are limited. so i'm worried that, you know, either will run out of those and then we'll have to find another solution or they'll become. so scarce that the price will just go up and up and up. and just like you said, things will just become more expensive even though they're supposed to be good and better. they're actually just a lot more expensive and not really solving anything."
Adam M,21:58:00-22:40:00," i mean, when it comes to cost and why things cost more, i think things always cost the same. we just haven't been paying the price, right, pete. we've been shipping it overseas and they the pollutions overseas, or it's our children who are going to pay the price by living on a ruined planet. so, you know, we can either pay money energy, now, to solve these problems or people are going to be paying later and you know, i want some think it's sometimes i regret having kids because i'm like they're going this is gonna be bad and maybe i should have had kids. so it's that bad or i think it is."
Roxanne B,22:40:00-23:21," can everybody hear me? anyways, i think that some of the stuff we're discussing like going all electrical can be expensive and like one person said earlier us lok and in low-income people aren't going to be able to afford for repairs and things that to me fix when they break down. that's all i have to say."
steviek6,23:21-23:38," i'd like to just tone it on that one and say that it seems like they're trying to get to a place now where the wealthy start to pay more of their share, and i think that would be beneficial as well."
Moderator,23:38-23:47, we are moving on to the next item on the agenda...
Moderator,34:13:00-34:22:00, we are moving on to the next item on the agenda...
Moderator,34:22:00-35:17:00," there are three proposals for our discussion on methane use. they are focused on whether and how to use methane in the us. first, the u.s. government should issue methane standards to reduce emissions from fossil fuel facilities. second, in order to reduce methane emissions produced by livestock, the us should launch an educational campaign to encourage people to reduce their meat and dairy consumption. and, third, the u.s. government should limit allowable greenhouse gas emissions including methane from large farms, just as it sets limits for industrial sources. now, what do you think about methane? please share your thoughts whether in support or opposition."
Francis,35:17:00-35:47:00," i mean we could all probably use with less red meat and our diets, but i think just telling the people that they need to cut it out as really going to do much as far as regulating it at like a farm level, that could potentially be done. but how is that going to impact the economy? there's a lot of questions involved. but, yeah, i'm down for cutting out. a few hamburgers every now and again."
Laura,35:47:00-36:32:00," i definitely do not support that second proposal about an educational campaign to cut out meat because that is going to be interpreted by the american public. and oh, we can't ever eat meat at all. so that's not going to go over too. well for farmers like me. who do raise livestock. we are very cognizant of the fact that we are a methane. emitter. we are regulated by the state of new york. if you have over three hundred head of cattle, you have to have a full nutrient plan for your farm and methane is somehow included in that plan or a little bit under that number. so i'm not super familiar, but we're very on top of these issues in farming. so don't need the government to help."
Wendi,36:32:00-36:59:00," yeah, i'm not willing to give up beef at for to put farmers out of work. something should probably be done, but there's a way other than giving up beef. it's yeah, i live in the united states. don't don't start telling me not to eat beef. it's that would just make me pretty unhappy."
Charles,36:59:00-37:42:00," yeah, i guess i just don't understand the idea of coming up with a rule based on some percentages. i think if you're going to have this kind of regulation and it gets better done at the local level where, you know, community can decide together on how they want to manage how big a farm is, and how many livestock there are, and there's just not enough data in this. this slide here to to convince me that, you know, cows are our problem with global warming. i gotta imagine the sun is doing a lot more control on global warming than cows."
Amanda,37:42:00-38:27:00," i don't know. i feel like regulating because i like how they were at that its large farms. not your, you know, i mean, i'm assuming if you're only talking about, you know, three hundred head of cattle. that's not what i think about. when i think of like the big mass producing on farms that would cause as much issues as that, i mean, because we have a small homestead and we have, you know, tons of little animals that i'm sure. methane gases. but i mean that also comes into food waste, how much of that mass amount of food that we're making from the beef is getting wasted but still polluting."
Adam M,38:27:00-39:03:00," i think we just need to make people pay for the externalities. so, you know, there's a cost to everything. there's a cost to the beef right now. you just pay the farmer for the be for, you know, the supermarket, etc. etc. but that methane the cost of that methane is being paid by the planet and future generations. we just need to make beef more expensive so that you know, people will eat less and you know, in the cap-and-trade thing where it's the the dollar, the methane, dollar amount is being translated. i don't exactly sure how that works, but i think a markets market. but it'll take a governor. it'll take some sort of government regulation to put that price but that methane the price of methane on top of it. and i know i love beef and i don't want to pay more for beef, but"
Laura,39:03:00-39:23:00," we should let them mark 8. yeah, let the market shift towards more chicken less beef. exactly."
Nestor Flores,39:23:00-39:58:00," yeah, i support introducing methane. standards to these large facilities and corporations. but as for the forms themselves, like i don't want to like harm with these with a regulation. i don't want to stop eating meat, but, you know, i agree what he said about taxing people, introducing to the market higher cost to discourage me consumed. just like lower it."
steviek6,39:58:00-40:43:00," well, i think it's interesting because we have an economic choice here. so i basically vegetarian even though i have meat sometimes because my wife is a mediator. so i need a lot of veggie burgers and things like that. as far as the methane from the cows. i mean, you know, it's science. i mean, they definitely producing a lot of methane. we have to be careful of that because it's a terrible greenhouse gas. and the question is how quickly do we have to get off of diet based upon? so sure everybody that can have a little bit of me, but we have to reduce our desire for it or we have to kind of take options to look at alternatives. you know, it's a really hard choice. i live in colorado. so there's a lot of kind of ride around my back."
Angie Walker,40:43:00-41:11:00," i think we just need to be careful with placing regulations on things like that. i think it can be a slippery slope and just you know, weighing those pros and cons again to you know, people are choices in the economy as well, you know, as the environment."
Richie,33:26:00-34:10:00," well, i think that if the government doesn't put a standard or some limits on stuff for the start of it, i don't think anybody's going to move anywhere. there's nobody moves anywhere without they sent them, shall we say? and then the other thing with dairy farms, is there a way to recoup the efta product, if you will of these animals that you know, if you had him in a big barn or you had them somewhere that they could pick contain the methane and then burn it. if that works. i don't know. i'm not a dairy farmer seen pictures of cows. coming from new york city, but that's about it."
Jim,34:10:00-34:53:00," i'm definitely in the big farming, agricultural, dairy area and they all reuse that to fertilizer fields, you know, the big manure pits at they're circulating that in and drying it and spreading it then and later years and that's amish farms, you know, this area. they're all doing that. but one thing i see you've met the sewer plant. they're burning a methane torch just out next to the plan, just going up in flames, which can when you're talking about earlier heating, the steam moving again. later that he could definitely be used for something that would be cost effective. so i just see a lot of people aren't even thinking about some of those things and easy solutions. try using the energy. it's being wasted."
Caitlin,34:53:00-35:31:00," the video has mentioned to, you know, at some point education campaigns to promote a more vegetarian lifestyle. if you will, i'm in favor of that very much. so i don't think people have to give up meat completely, but i think the us we are huge beef eaters and i think we all know that they're, you know, the health benefits of eating vegetables and not to mention the treatment of animals. i'm, i'm very much in favor of having that to be one of the small things that we can do to make a bigger difference. is educating. our community is about, you know, meat-free mondays or trying to do a bit better than that."
Keith,35:31:00-36:15:00," yeah, and the us here, we're creatures of habit to just think about changing our lifestyle, the way we eat, what we eat, you know, all those things and even in the rest of the world, really, it's, it's just hard to think about and i'm just using myself. as an example saying, am i willing to change that much. i mean, can i change that much, you know, it sounds good on the surface, but when it comes time to do it and one has to do it, you know, for the, you know, the bigger picture. it's it's just hard to fathom. so i really don't know. i just looking for answers. thank you guys."
Darshana,36:15:00-37:00:00," one of the things that really surprises me and all sorts of discussions is they never talk about the difference between chemical free food and organic vegetables. and i think we really need. i never eat feedlot meat. i don't think anybody should eat feedlot meat or dairy because it's horrible for the animals and it's really horrible for the planet, but are organically grown vegetables and organically grown meat on much smaller farms is not unsustainable. and in fact, it does regenerate the land and i think that's a big difference. we should eat less meat than we do for sure, but it should always be sustainable, meat from small farms or wild-caught buffalo. that's restoring the prairie and like wild idea buffalo company."
