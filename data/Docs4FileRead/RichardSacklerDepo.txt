Speaker 3    00:03:15    Um, excuse me. I, I, there are a number of defendants, uh, with bear, some portion of the Purdue name and the distinction can be significant. So I'd ask when, when you phrase your questions, specify which Purdue entity you are  
Speaker 2    00:03:30    Talking about? Well, let's, uh, let's talk about the number of Purdue entities. There are, uh, how many Purdue entities are  
Speaker 6    00:03:35    There? I don't know. Okay.  
Speaker 2    00:03:38    I've seen upwards of 69 different corporations perhaps that, uh, the Sackler family owns. Is that correct?  
Speaker 6    00:03:46    If you've counted them? I can't differ with you. I don't know the answer. Okay.  
Speaker 2    00:03:51    Um, there are a number of Purdue entities. Um, the Purdue Frederick company, Inc. Does it still exist?  
Speaker 6    00:04:05    I don't know.  
Speaker 2    00:04:06    Okay. Um, tell me what companies that you currently, uh, have a role with that, uh, involve Purdue.  
Speaker 6    00:04:17    Purdue Pharma.  
Speaker 2    00:04:18    Okay. Do you sit on the board of any other Purdue companies?  
Speaker 6    00:04:23    Not to my knowledge.  
Speaker 2    00:04:24    Okay. What about Monday Pharma?  
Speaker 6    00:04:29    I sit on the board of an, a consulting firm, which consults to Munda Pharma.  
Speaker 2    00:04:37    Okay. Does the Sackler family own MUN Pharma? Yes. Uh, what about, uh, what is Mundi Pharma?  
Speaker 6    00:04:42    Mundi Pharma is, is a name that is attached to many different companies, such as just similar to Purdue.  
Speaker 2    00:04:54    Okay. Is that company over in Germany?  
Speaker 6    00:04:57    There is a Munda Pharma company in Germany.  
Speaker 2    00:05:00    Uh, what about Roxanne? Does Purdue own Roxanne?  
Speaker 6    00:05:04    No.  
Speaker 2    00:05:05    Have, did they own Roxanne in the past?  
Speaker 6    00:05:07    Never  
Speaker 2    00:05:07    All. Um, do you know how many current companies, uh, are owned by the Sackler family?  
Speaker 6    00:05:15    No. All  
Speaker 2    00:05:16    Right. In, in discussing OxyContin, how many companies were involved in the production, manufacturing or distribution of OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    00:05:27    I Oxycon. Could you specify the geography  
Speaker 2    00:05:36    In the world?  
Speaker 6    00:05:38    Many. Okay. I've never counted them.  
Speaker 2    00:05:42    Um, just Purdue do licensing agreements with other companies to sell Oxycon it does. Do they own parts of those companies?  
Speaker 6    00:05:51    No.  
Speaker 2    00:05:52    How many companies does Purdue own that? Uh, distributes or dispenses OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    00:06:00    Many.  
Speaker 2    00:06:02    Can you tell me the names of them?  
Speaker 6    00:06:06    A few of them, but not all of them.  
Speaker 2    00:06:12    Are you still the director of Purdue Pharma, Inc?  
Speaker 6    00:06:17    I'm not sure.  
Speaker 0    00:06:19    Okay.  
Speaker 2    00:06:20    Are you still a general partner of Purdue Pharma LP?  
Speaker 6    00:06:24    I am not. I, it is owned by two trusts  
Speaker 2    00:06:40    In July 30th, 2014. Were you a director of Purdue Pharma, Inc?  
Speaker 6    00:06:50    Not that I'm aware.  
Speaker 0    00:06:52    Okay.  
Speaker 2    00:06:55    This is a affidavit filed in the Southern district of West Virginia. Um, and does that appear to be your name  
Speaker 6    00:07:03    That does,  
Speaker 2    00:07:04    And it's dated, uh, July 30th, 2014. It says declaration of Dr. Richard Richard S Sackler. I am a director of Purdue Pharma, Inc. The general partner of Purdue Pharma LP. I've held disposition since 1990.  
Speaker 6    00:07:19    If that's what it says, then that's what it says. Okay.  
Speaker 2    00:07:27    How involved were you in the production and, um, marketing and promotion in the training and management of Purdue sales representatives for OxyContin.  
Speaker 0    00:07:45    I object to the form of the question. <affirmative>  
Speaker 6    00:07:49    Should I answer? Go ahead.  
Speaker 0    00:07:51    You can answer.  
Speaker 6    00:07:52    It depends on the time.  
Speaker 2    00:07:56    Okay. And when you say it depends on the time, why do you say that?  
Speaker 6    00:07:59    Because I was involved in the areas, um, is, um, at a supervisory level, not as an active level for a period of time, that began with the launching of OxyContin and ended in early 2003,  
Speaker 2    00:08:25    When you were involved on the supervisory level, but not the active level. How much of your day to day activity was devoted to OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    00:08:38    It varied enormously  
Speaker 2    00:08:43    In this declaration. Uh, it says, uh, during the time period set forth in the amended complaint, 1996 to 2009, I was not directly involved with the day-to-day marketing or promotion of OxyContin, the training or management of Purdue sales representative, or the scientific research into the conversion ratio from MS. Contin to OxyContin. Um, those responsibilities fell principally fail to produce senior management in research and development, regulatory fair sales, affairs, sales, training, and marketing among others. Uh, is that accurate?  
Speaker 6    00:09:18    Yes.  
Speaker 2    00:09:27    I want to show you email Dr. Sackler dated Monday, May 31st, 1999. Uh, do you know who Cornelia Dr. Cornelia Hinch is?  
Speaker 6    00:09:41    I  
Speaker 2    00:09:41    Do. And who is that?  
Speaker 6    00:09:44    She was general manager of Munda Pharma, Australia.  
Speaker 2    00:09:51    Okay. And to give this a little bit of context, you all had a drug called Ms. Cotton, a morphine sulfate, uh, that was an immediate release narcotic opioid or narcotic, is that correct?  
Speaker 6    00:10:06    It was controlled release  
Speaker 2    00:10:08    Controlled release. I'm sorry. And that was used primarily for cancer patients or malignant pain patients. Is that correct?  
Speaker 6    00:10:18    Majority of use, yes, but not. I, I don't think primarily conveys an accurate picture.  
Speaker 2    00:10:26    Okay. Majority of use  
Speaker 6    00:10:28    Was for over 50%  
Speaker 2    00:10:31    And it was sort of felt by Purdue Pharma that, that morphine had a stigma attached to it that kept doctors from prescribing it, uh, um, across the board. Is that accurate?  
Speaker 6    00:10:45    Yes.  
Speaker 2    00:10:46    And you all had a, uh,  
Speaker 6    00:10:49    May I amend that?  
Speaker 2    00:10:50    Yes.  
Speaker 6    00:10:52    It didn't prevent doctors from prescribing it across the board. It was an inhibition to the use of the product in every application.  
Speaker 2    00:11:05    Okay. Have you ever gone back and studied the history of addiction and, and how it has played out in the 19th and 20th century?  
Speaker 6    00:11:15    I'm not a student of that literature. All  
Speaker 2    00:11:17    Right. Um, what was your understanding of why doctors did not want to prescribe morphine for anything, uh, or had a stigma about prescribing it for anything other than cancer and malignant pain?  
Speaker 6    00:11:35    As I said before, the stigma prevented many physicians from prescribing it for any pain. Mm-hmm <affirmative>.  
Speaker 2    00:11:44    Why do you think that stigma existed?  
Speaker 6    00:11:54    I'm not a student of the issue, but I believe that the stigma existed because of a popular understanding shared by both professionals and by layman, that morphine was an end of life drug, if it was to be used at all.  
Speaker 2    00:12:19    Okay. Um, were there concerns about addiction, uh, and, um, dependence with respect to morphine?  
Speaker 6    00:12:34    Some people had those concerns.  
Speaker 2    00:12:37    So going back to building our context here, you all had a drug called MS. Contin that, um, you had the exclusive right to sell. Is that correct?  
Speaker 6    00:12:49    That's correct.  
Speaker 2    00:12:50    Do you know when that exclusivity was set to expire?  
Speaker 6    00:12:56    Um, I, I'm not certain that I know the, the date. No.  
Speaker 2    00:13:02    Do you recall that? One of the concerns that Purdue, uh, senior management had, I'm using Purdue in relation to Purdue companies that are involved with OxyContin, and rather than just sit here and name 'em all out. Can we agree that when I say Purdue, I'm referring to Purdue companies involved  
Speaker 3    00:13:22    Of ox? I have, I have to object to that because I said at the outset, there are different Purdue entities that are defendants in the case. And the distinction between them may at times be significant. And so if you lump them all together under Purdue, we're gonna get a record that will not be easily decipherable at the end.  
Speaker 2    00:13:40    Well, let's, let's talk about it then. Which Purdue companies were involved in the cell and distribution of OxyContin,  
Speaker 6    00:13:48    Both Purdue, Frederick and Purdue Pharma were involved in the early years of selling the product.  
Speaker 2    00:13:55    Okay. Were there any other Purdue companies involved in the selling of the product?  
Speaker 6    00:14:00    Not in the us. Okay.  
Speaker 2    00:14:04    Um, who had the exclusive right to sell Ms. Cotton  
Speaker 6    00:14:19    At first bef it was Purdue Frederick. Okay. I, I don't know. At what point Purdue Pharma acquired rights to sell it, or if it did at all. Okay.  
Speaker 2    00:14:34    What is the distinction between Purdue Frederick and Purdue Pharma?  
Speaker 6    00:14:39    Purdue Frederick was the original company that my father and uncle acquired 1952. It was a shell company and it was the first pharmaceutical company that they owned. Purdue Pharma was established in the early 1990s to take on new products and to also take on the, the risk of, well take on the risk of new products and also a few established products, but not all.  
Speaker 2    00:15:22    Were there any actions taken with respect to Purdue, um, or, or with respect to OxyContin that would not fall under the Purdue Pharma umbrella?  
Speaker 6    00:15:34    I'm sorry. Could, could you repeat the  
Speaker 2    00:15:36    Question? Yeah. Are, are you, are you maintaining that there are any actions done with respect to OxyContin it's it's creation, production, marketing sales that do not fall under the Purdue Pharma umbrella?  
Speaker 6    00:15:54    Its creation, uh, was done in Purdue Frederick.  
Speaker 2    00:15:58    Okay.  
Speaker 6    00:15:59    Um, until the early nineties, when that responsibility was transferred to Purdue Pharma.  
Speaker 2    00:16:09    Okay. And then Purdue Frederick continued to exist though, correct?  
Speaker 6    00:16:14    It did.  
Speaker 2    00:16:15    Okay. And was Purdue Frederick also a company involved with marketing, promoting, um, uh, sales and production of OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    00:16:34    I'm trying to give you an accurate answer because this is confusing and complex. There was a period of time in which once Purdue Pharma became involved, the Purdue Frederick was involved, but Purdue Frederick was never involved nor Purdue Pharma in manufacturing, the drug, which was when it was developed, uh, was manufactured by a company named PF Laboratories.  
Speaker 2    00:17:08    Okay. Other than the manufacturer did, did Purdue Frederick and Purdue Pharma both play a role in the,  
Speaker 6    00:17:15    I can't recall in detail whether they both played a role or whether when Purdue Pharma took on the project, it carried most of the weight.  
Speaker 2    00:17:28    Okay. Is there, or all of it? Is there any difference between the employees of Purdue, Frederick and Purdue Pharma?  
Speaker 6    00:17:35    There were differences.  
Speaker 2    00:17:36    Okay. Any difference in the board of directors  
Speaker 6    00:17:40    That would test my memory and I'm not sure. All  
Speaker 2    00:17:43    Right. Well, let me go back to, let's talk about, um, OxyContin and I'm gonna use the term Purdue for both Purdue, Frederick and Purdue Pharma. Um, if at some point you, you feel like there's a distinction to be made you let me know. Okay. Um, but, um, at a time when  
Speaker 3    00:18:06    Ms. Thompson, I object to your, combining the two under the name, Purdue, if you're going to do it, then I'd like to have a standing objection to that  
Speaker 2    00:18:15    Combination. What is your reason for the objection?  
Speaker 3    00:18:19    My reason is, as Dr. Sackler has explained briefly, there were two entities that did different things at different times. And if you lump the two together, uh, inevitably there's gonna be confusion in terms of the witness's answer.  
Speaker 2    00:18:33    Okay, let's do this. I'm gonna refer to Purdue as, as Purdue Pharma LP. Um, and also Purdue Frederick LP, if at some point, uh, you feel like it's only Purdue Frederick or only Purdue Pharma, you let me know. Okay.  
Speaker 6    00:18:56    It's kind of a burden, but, um, with, with the help of my attorney. Sure.  
Speaker 2    00:19:01    Um, so let's  
Speaker 6    00:19:02    Because there may be issues it's, it's going to be, it tests my memory to separate the two. So I'm sorry for the confusion, but it is important.  
Speaker 2    00:19:23    For instance, let me ask you this sales reps, uh, were sales reps employed by Purdue Frederick or Purdue Pharma  
Speaker 6    00:19:31    For a period of time, they were sale. Each sales rep was employed by one, but not necessarily the other. Okay.  
Speaker 2    00:19:38    Do you know which sales reps were employed by? Purdue? Frederick  
Speaker 6    00:19:42    Pharma? I don't know.  
Speaker 0    00:19:44    Okay. Some different training.  
Speaker 2    00:19:50    Do you know if they received different training?  
Speaker 6    00:19:53    I believe the training was the same.  
Speaker 2    00:19:55    Okay. Um, well, I'll tell you what I, I'm gonna refer to when I say Purdue as Purdue Frederick, if you feel like it's Purdue Pharma, you let me know. Okay. Okay. All right. So back in 19 early nineties, when you're developing Ms. Cotton, um, um, this exclusive license that you had to sell, Ms. Con Ms. Cotton was going to expire and there was gonna be competition from generic companies, correct?  
Speaker 6    00:20:28    Well, the product Ms. Cotton was developed in the late seventies and early eighties. And, okay. And so are you discussing development or are you discussing a later time?  
Speaker 2    00:20:43    The later time when its license is about to expire?  
Speaker 6    00:20:50    Eventually we knew that there would be competition for Ms comp.  
Speaker 2    00:20:57    And one of the things that in developing oxycodone, um, uh, controlled release, one of the, one of the concerns was how to position it in the market. Uh, and whether you were gonna position it, uh, an obsolete Ms. Cotton, or try to position it alongside Ms. Cotton was, do you recall that issue?  
Speaker 3    00:21:20    I object to the form of the question. Could you repeat, I'm not sure. I understood  
Speaker 2    00:21:25    One of the concerns when, when you were developing oxycodone, uh, or I'm sorry, OxyContin controlled release was how you were gonna position it for market share, and whether you were gonna position it and make Ms. Cotton obsolete, uh, and take that market, share that Ms. Cotton had, or whether you were gonna position it alongside Ms. Cotton and, uh, sell them both together. Do you recall that concern?  
Speaker 6    00:21:54    I recall discussions, but that wasn't the principal driver, the principal, the principal go, the principle goal was to produce the best product we could. And we believed when we started it. And subsequently, should I stop? No,  
Speaker 2    00:22:16    No. That's  
Speaker 6    00:22:17    We believed it was and is a better product than Ms. Gone.  
Speaker 0    00:22:23    Okay.  
Speaker 2    00:22:26    Here's a memo dated, um, uh, to Richard Sackler, um, from Robert Keiko. Do you know Dr. Keiko? I do. He's a PhD. What he is, what was his role?  
Speaker 6    00:22:47    He was the person who undertook or ran the project and was involved in the project of D of developing OxyContin and was as a clinical pharmacologist was deeply involved in, uh, selecting formulations. That would be most likely to achieve the desired effect.  
Speaker 2    00:23:12    Okay. And under here, it says rationale for another controlled release opioid analgesic. This is Bates number. It's actually got two Bates stamps. So, um, it's PDD 9 5 2 0 8 0 5 2 92, but it says rationale for another controlled release opioid analgesic, Ms. Cotton may eventually face such serious generic competition that other controlled release opioids must be considered. Other pharmaceutical firms are thought to also be developing other controlled release opioid analgesics.  
Speaker 3    00:23:55    Mr. Thompson, if you're reading from a document, could you show it to the witness?  
Speaker 2    00:23:58    Sure. That's why I was holding it over here in front. It's  
Speaker 3    00:24:02    It's hard to that  
Speaker 2    00:24:04    Distance. Extra copy.  
Speaker 0    00:24:05    Yeah, we have copy.  
Speaker 2    00:24:07    Great. Just always hand  
Speaker 3    00:24:08    You copy for me also.  
Speaker 0    00:24:11    Thank you.  
Speaker 2    00:24:13    So do you see down there, the second highlighted portion that says right?  
Speaker 6    00:24:17    Mine is not highlighted, so  
Speaker 2    00:24:20    Yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll tell you where it goes.  
Speaker 6    00:24:22    Okay.  
Speaker 2    00:24:22    Okay. So the second highlighted portion rationale for another controlled release opioid analgesic. And do you see the first sentence below that?  
Speaker 6    00:24:34    Oh, I see. That's a cross title.  
Speaker 2    00:24:37    Yes.  
Speaker 6    00:24:38    I was looking at the text  
Speaker 2    00:24:42    And the text below that says, Ms. Cotton may eventually face such serious generic competition that other controlled release opioids must be considered. Other pharmaceutical firms are thought to be, to also be developing other controlled release opioid analgesics. Did I read that correctly?  
Speaker 6    00:25:02    You did.  
Speaker 2    00:25:02    And was that a concern at that time?  
Speaker 6    00:25:05    It was a secondary or tertiary driver.  
Speaker 2    00:25:12    And then if you'll turn to the next page and look at the second paragraph and I'll read that it says while we have reason to believe that other pharmaceutical firms are formulating controlled release morphine and controlled release hydromorphone, there is no evidence to date that this is being done with oxycodone, a controlled release. Oxycodone is thus less likely to initially have generic competition. And was that a, a, uh, consideration when deciding to come out with oxycodone or OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    00:25:55    Not for me.  
Speaker 2    00:25:57    All right. Now we read your paragraph 11, where you discussed that you had limited role in the,  
Speaker 0    00:26:18    Have a copy of that affidavit.  
Speaker 2    00:26:22    Paragraph 11, let's make this, um, exhibit one to the deposition. I need to see that back please. Um,  
Speaker 6    00:26:51    Is this the same as this? Thank you for,  
Speaker 2    00:27:00    Yeah. Um, and this declaration said that you were not, uh, directly involved with the day to day marketing or promotion of OxyContin, the training or management of the Purdue sales representatives or the scientific research into the conversion ratio of, of MS. Contin to OxyContin. Um, is that correct?  
Speaker 6    00:27:22    That is correct.  
Speaker 2    00:27:24    I want to show you a, an email let's mark this exhibit two to the deposition.  
Speaker 0    00:27:44    Which one is it? Actually, lemme  
Speaker 6    00:27:47    See this, allow me to just clarify, I'm emphasizing directly involved. I didn't do any of the work. I didn't do any of the training. I was not a salesperson. Okay. But as a senior executive, I certainly was aware of what was going on and I consulted with other senior executives about what was going on and what should be going on and so on.  
Speaker 2    00:28:16    Okay. And then this, um, email that was just handed to you, um, a few moments ago says, uh, again, it's Cornelia Hinch. Um, it's dated May 29th, 1999. Um, it says, uh, if you'll read the highlighted portion, it says, this is an email from you to her, correct?  
Speaker 6    00:28:53    Yes.  
Speaker 2    00:28:54    It says you won't believe how committed I am to make OxyContin a huge success. It is almost that I dedicated my life to it. After the initial launch phase, I will have to catch up with my private life again. Did I read that correctly? You  
Speaker 6    00:29:10    Did.  
Speaker 2    00:29:11    When you say you dedicated your life to it, uh, and that you have no time for your private life. What were your day to day activities with respect to OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    00:29:25    Well, may I read the, the whole document? I haven't seen this for 16 years.  
Speaker 2    00:29:43    Have you read your deposition in the endo litigation?  
Speaker 6    00:29:47    No. In preparation for this? Yes. No,  
Speaker 0    00:30:18    I'm sorry.  
Speaker 6    00:30:28    The context of this was to encourage Dr. Hench, who was the head of the Australian business and was meeting with great success with Ms. Cotton to pay perhaps more attention than I thought she was paying to the prospects of potential for OxyContin. And so this was in the spirit of motivating her. Um, it was true that I was very Gladden to see that OxyContin was meeting with. So with such a strong, positive reception by both physicians and patients, and I was working hard at the business. But it, if, if you, you would misinterpret this, if you thought that I was working only on OxyContin, that was not the case.  
Speaker 2    00:31:48    Okay. When you say you were encouraged by the number of physicians that were selling it, um,  
Speaker 6    00:31:55    Prescribing  
Speaker 2    00:31:56    It, prescribing it, you were not aware at this time, were you, or were you aware that your, um, uh, company was committing a felony and how they were marketing and branding the drug?  
Speaker 0    00:32:12    I object to the form of the question.  
Speaker 6    00:32:17    I was not aware at all of, uh, of what you're, you're saying. Um, and when I say I was heartened by physicians reception, when I did speak to physicians at meetings, I didn't go on sales calls, but at some meetings and conferences, they were extremely enthusiastic about the effectiveness and the safety and the reception, their patients had response. They had to the product. That was what I was referring to. Um, because as I had told you before, our goal was to make a better product than Ms. Cotton. And I believe we, this, this was one of the ratifications of that.  
Speaker 2    00:33:08    Let's mark this exhibit three.  
Speaker 3    00:33:22    May I have a copy?  
Speaker 0    00:33:27    You have a copy.  
Speaker 3    00:33:29    May I have a copy?  
Speaker 8    00:33:31    You already have it?  
Speaker 3    00:33:32    No, the witness has it. I'd like to  
Speaker 8    00:33:33    Have a copy. I think you, you have it in front of you in your hand is physically on it.  
Speaker 0    00:33:38    You,  
Speaker 3    00:33:40    You tell me, I don't say it.  
Speaker 8    00:33:41    Yeah. You're holding it.  
Speaker 3    00:33:44    I'm holding one and two  
Speaker 8    00:33:47    That email that you have your hand on. There's three. We may have just marked it twice. That may be the problem. Yeah. It just got marked  
Speaker 3    00:33:56    Twice. Well, if you mark, if you marked it twice, then it's so three and two are the same. Yeah. Okay. Then I have it. Cause I have two  
Speaker 2    00:34:02    And we'll get into this a little more later on, but you're aware that Purdue pled guilty to a felony charge of misbranding a drug, which was OxyContin with the intent to defraud or mislead. You, you are aware of that, correct.  
Speaker 6    00:34:21    Uh, you said  
Speaker 3    00:34:22    Purdue, that is Purdue. That is Purdue to your earlier statement. That is Purdue Frederick. Is that right? Yeah.  
Speaker 6    00:34:31    Okay. So when you said Purdue, you meant Purdue Frederick  
Speaker 2    00:34:34    Purdue Frederick company. E  
Speaker 6    00:34:36    Yes. I, I am aware.  
Speaker 0    00:34:38    Okay.  
Speaker 2    00:34:44    Yeah. Did you, is it your understanding that the fraud, um, uh, only occurred with respect to the Purdue Frederick company and not with respect to Purdue Pharma, LLP?  
Speaker 6    00:35:04    That's my understanding, but I'm not an attorney and I'm, I, that's a very deep legal question.  
Speaker 2    00:35:11    Did you do any investigation to find out whether were, uh, sales reps employed by Purdue Pharma, uh, were, um, exceeding, uh, what they were allowed to do? Uh, and when they were marketing that they were making claims that were untrue.  
Speaker 3    00:35:34    Yeah. Objection to form. He can answer.  
Speaker 6    00:35:41    When you say you, are you referring to me personally, or are you referring to the company?  
Speaker 2    00:35:47    Uh, I'm referring to you personally.  
Speaker 6    00:35:50    I did not conduct or manage any investigation, but from the time we learned at top management levels that there was an abuse and diversion problem, which was years before the settlement with the government. We launched multiple investigations, both with inside resources and people, and with external attorneys and others to identify. And this was before any charges were made to identify if we had in any sense misled or, or, or caused this to happen. Um, more important. We spent enormous resources to try to mitigate the problem, whatever the cost was and that effort, which was launched sometime in 2000 or 2001 continued right through the period that you're referring to of the plea with the us government.  
Speaker 2    00:37:11    And, and did you all launch this investigation as soon as you learned there was a problem?  
Speaker 6    00:37:16    Yes. Within, within months or weeks? I can't recall. It was 16, 15, 16 years ago.  
Speaker 2    00:37:25    Do you re uh, who's Michael  
Speaker 6    00:37:29    Friedman is the, was at that time, the head of sales and marketing.  
Speaker 2    00:37:36    Uh, have you seen his presentation at Purdue that he, uh, uh, do you know what at Purdue is the Bureau's internal newsletter that goes out to all the employees?  
Speaker 6    00:37:49    I don't believe I saw a presentation at Purdue from him.  
Speaker 2    00:37:56    Um, alright. We'll get to that later. Um, copies of this is a memorandum dated, um,  
Speaker 0    00:38:13    Um,  
Speaker 2    00:38:17    July 15th, 1992 meeting with chk held Wednesday, July 24th, 1992 from Dr. JW Watkins. Uh, and there's a distribution list and I assume you are Dr. RS Sackler. Is that correct?  
Speaker 6    00:38:35    That would be me. Okay.  
Speaker 2    00:38:37    And if you would turn to page six of this document, that is P D D 1 7 0 1 5 4 6 2 2 6. And to give it a little context, Sheia Nogi, uh, is that a Japanese company?  
Speaker 6    00:38:59    It is.  
Speaker 2    00:39:00    And at one time, were you all talking about doing some sort of business with them involving potentially, uh, OxyContin controlled release?  
Speaker 6    00:39:10    Yes.  
Speaker 2    00:39:10    Uh, and did you do business with them involving OxyContin controlled release?  
Speaker 6    00:39:15    Yes.  
Speaker 2    00:39:17    Let's look at page six, if you would the, um, looks like maybe the third paragraph down that begins with Dr. Keiko. Yes. Do you see that Dr. Keiko presented two options identified for positioning of oxycodone aro Contin. Now, is that the controlled release?  
Speaker 6    00:39:36    That was our working title of the controlled release system. Okay.  
Speaker 2    00:39:43    Versus MST cotton tablets in the us. The first was relevant if PF, who is PF  
Speaker 6    00:39:51    Purdue, Frederick  
Speaker 2    00:39:53    Did not suffer substantial erosion of its MS Contin market by generic competition. This envision using oxycodone Aqua Contin tablets over the entire spectrum of pain in patients whose treatment had been initiated with this product whilst Ms. Cotton tablets would be used as therapy for chronic severe pain in patients who were changed from other medication, including oxycodone, Aqua Contin tablets, an alternative scenario would apply if Ms. Cotton tablets were subject to erosion by generic competitors. In this case, oxycodone, Aqua Contin tablets would be promoted for the use across the entire pain spectrum, including those patients who might otherwise receive controlled release morphine. Did I read that correctly?  
Speaker 6    00:40:39    You did.  
Speaker 2    00:40:40    Okay. And was it your intent, uh, to promote OxyContin, um, controlled release across the entire pain spectrum  
Speaker 6    00:40:54    Where you're referring to Japan, which is where she and OGI either had, or was negotiating a license for OxyContin?  
Speaker 2    00:41:08    Was it also your intent in the us to promote it across the entire pain spectrum?  
Speaker 6    00:41:14    It was our hope that it would be well received, uh, for pain, moderate to severe pain requiring opioids.  
Speaker 2    00:41:24    Okay. Let's mark this as exhibit  
Speaker 0    00:41:29    Four.  
Speaker 2    00:41:45    Okay. And here is, um, P D D 9 5 2 4 7 0 6 4 2 6 OxyContin launch team memo dated 3 31 95. And OxyContin was actually launched in January of 96. Is that correct?  
Speaker 6    00:42:09    That sounds correct.  
Speaker 2    00:42:11    And what this says, if you will turn to page three, first of all, let me ask you this. Do you recall having any significant problem with Ms. Cotton, uh, with respect to a addiction abuse, diversion, or any of the problems that you experienced with OxyContin CR  
Speaker 6    00:42:35    I, I recall never hearing about that.  
Speaker 2    00:42:39    All right. So let's look at, uh, page two, the last paragraph, it says our meeting ended with a question and comment period. Michael Friedman emphasized the threat that AB rated generics posed to Ms. Cotton. We're not sure when AB rated generics will be launched, but we don't think it will be until 1996, inevitably AB rated generics will arrive. And this is why it is of extreme, timely importance that we must establish OxyContin. OxyContin can cure the vulnerability of the AB rated generic threat. And that is why it is so crucial that we devote our fullest efforts now to a successful launch of OxyContin. Um, did I read that correctly?  
Speaker 6    00:43:33    You did.  
Speaker 2    00:43:35    And who is Lydia Johnson?  
Speaker 6    00:43:43    I don't know.  
Speaker 2    00:43:45    Uh, this department, it looks like it's the marketing department. Is that right?  
Speaker 6    00:43:53    I just see a distribution list. I don't see a source. I don't know. It says that the department is marketing, but I don't know Lydia Johnson.  
Speaker 2    00:44:21    Was it your belief that it was of extreme, timely importance that OxyContin be established because AB generics were going to arrive and compete with Ms. Cotton?  
Speaker 6    00:44:34    No.  
Speaker 0    00:44:36    All  
Speaker 2    00:44:37    Let's mark this as exhibit four.  
Speaker 3    00:44:44    Uh, we, no, we already have four.  
Speaker 2    00:44:46    I'm  
Speaker 0    00:44:46    Sorry,  
Speaker 2    00:44:48    Then this would be, be five,  
Speaker 3    00:44:50    Five.  
Speaker 2    00:44:50    I'm sorry.  
Speaker 0    00:44:50    Okay. That's the launch team memo that I thought was already marked this for, is this what he's reading? That would be a question for gentlemen. I think, I think you already this as for pat, don't worry about marking it. We'll make sure it gets marked <laugh> hands.  
Speaker 2    00:45:12    Yeah. Okay.  
Speaker 3    00:45:13    Okay. I'm sorry. Where are we on the numbers?  
Speaker 2    00:45:16    I don't think this has been marked as an exhibit.  
Speaker 0    00:45:19    I thought the launch team memo was exhibit,  
Speaker 3    00:45:22    Uh, no four is something had map research center, the Japanese government.  
Speaker 2    00:45:29    Yeah. This has not been marked as an exhibit.  
Speaker 0    00:45:30    So let's, that's five,  
Speaker 2    00:45:33    Five. I'll  
Speaker 3    00:45:34    Keep track. Yeah, this should be five  
Speaker 2    00:45:44    Sackler. Do you know how much money to date has been generated by the sale of OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    00:45:53    I don't understand the question. Money generated.  
Speaker 2    00:45:57    How much money has Purdue Frederick or Purdue Pharma made off the sale of OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    00:46:02    I, I don't know.  
Speaker 2    00:46:04    Okay. Um, there was a article, um, last month in Forbes, the OxyContin clan, the 14 billion newcomer to Forbes 2015 list of the richest us families. Have you seen that?  
Speaker 6    00:46:23    I have seen it once.  
Speaker 2    00:46:25    Um, do you know what percentage of Purdue Pharma sales, uh, is made up of OxyContin  
Speaker 6    00:46:34    Presently?  
Speaker 2    00:46:35    Yes.  
Speaker 6    00:46:37    Approximately two thirds.  
Speaker 2    00:46:40    Um, okay. Um, I've, I've looked at the, the  
Speaker 6    00:46:46    That's Purdue Pharma sales  
Speaker 2    00:46:48    Sales, Purdue Frederick does not sell, um, anymore, correct? No. You've got another, a number of other entities that generate income from the sale of OxyContin, correct  
Speaker 6    00:47:01    Overseas?  
Speaker 2    00:47:01    Yes. And is it approximately 90% of the profits of the company come from OxyContin?  
Speaker 3    00:47:08    Uh, question the company you're referring to now, Purdue Pharma,  
Speaker 2    00:47:13    Purdue Pharma.  
Speaker 6    00:47:15    Uh, I don't believe it would be 90%, but it is certainly a majority.  
Speaker 2    00:47:22    Um, do you currently make over a billion dollars a year selling OxyContin?  
Speaker 3    00:47:31    Objection to the form by you now you're talking about Dr. Sackler.  
Speaker 2    00:47:38    Yes,  
Speaker 6    00:47:39    No I don't.  
Speaker 2    00:47:39    Right. Does Purdue Pharma make over a billion dollars a year?  
Speaker 6    00:47:43    I'm not sure. I don't think it would be that much.  
Speaker 2    00:47:47    Um, let's talk about gross sales are gross sales over $3 billion a year.  
Speaker 6    00:47:52    No, they're not.  
Speaker 2    00:47:53    What are the gross sales?  
Speaker 6    00:47:58    Well, I think what you're looking for is net sales because in the industry, a lot of money is inherently rebated back to purchasers insurance companies, hospitals, et cetera, through wholesale, um, in rebate agreements, which you negotiated. And so I believe the net sales are in the range of this year, a billion.  
Speaker 3    00:48:33    Okay. And your question was directed to Purdue Pharma,  
Speaker 2    00:48:35    Right? Purdue, Purdue Pharma.  
Speaker 6    00:48:36    Right.  
Speaker 2    00:48:38    Are there any other Purdue entities that make money that would not be included in that 1 billion sales  
Speaker 6    00:48:45    Objection  
Speaker 3    00:48:45    To the form of the question you can answer?  
Speaker 6    00:48:50    Not in the United States.  
Speaker 2    00:48:54    Do you know how much the Sackler family has made off the sale of OxyContin? I don't  
Speaker 6    00:48:59    Know,  
Speaker 2    00:49:00    But fair to say it's over a billion dollars.  
Speaker 6    00:49:04    It would be fair to say that. Yes.  
Speaker 2    00:49:06    Do you know if it's over 10 billion?  
Speaker 6    00:49:08    I don't think so.  
Speaker 2    00:49:10    You know, if it's over 5 billion,  
Speaker 6    00:49:11    I don't know.  
Speaker 0    00:49:12    All right.  
Speaker 2    00:49:45    This appears to me, uh, what's been marked as exhibit five. It's P K Y six six, I'm sorry. Six exhibit six, P K Y 1 7 3 8 1 0 2 0 0 6. Appears to be a profit calculation for, um, a Purdue entity. Can you tell me which entity that is?  
Speaker 6    00:50:14    If it's not on the document? I couldn't possibly tell you  
Speaker 2    00:50:38    Did Purdue Frederick still exist in 2006?  
Speaker 6    00:50:42    I'm not clear. I think it did.  
Speaker 2    00:50:47    This appears to be a, um, profit calculation for OxyContin tablets only. Do you see that?  
Speaker 6    00:50:56    I do.  
Speaker 2    00:50:57    And it appears that, um, at least by 2006 profit, uh, contribution was 4 million, uh, 4 billion, 718,767,000. Is that correct?  
Speaker 6    00:51:18    You've read the number correctly, but profit contribution is not profit.  
Speaker 2    00:51:25    And what would you subtract from that?  
Speaker 6    00:51:28    All of the money that was invested in, in the business to develop new products, that would be a major, uh, deduction from that.  
Speaker 0    00:51:46    Okay.  
Speaker 2    00:51:47    Let's mark this well let's you're right. I think it is, uh, look up at the top where it says gross profit, 7 billion, 500, 2 million, 367,000.  
Speaker 6    00:52:08    Just a second, small type, just a second. Gross profit. See gross sales. I see rebates and then net sales. Okay. I'm I'm with you on gross profit. Thank  
Speaker 2    00:52:25    You. Yeah. So deducted from that is shipping warehousing. You have 530, 6 million paid to Abbott for co promotion commission.  
Speaker 6    00:52:34    That's  
Speaker 2    00:52:35    Correct. You have an S and P expense. What's that?  
Speaker 6    00:52:38    Sales and promotion.  
Speaker 2    00:52:39    All right. That was, uh, 141 million, uh, on sales and promotion. Is that correct?  
Speaker 6    00:52:45    That's correct.  
Speaker 2    00:52:47    R and D expense? Um, 308 million,  
Speaker 6    00:52:52    Right. And I'm looking for the number. I'm sorry. I  
Speaker 2    00:52:56    Salesforce.  
Speaker 6    00:52:57    Yes. I see that. But can I explain that's the R and D associated with the product, right? Not the R and D for other products.  
Speaker 2    00:53:06    Right. And then Salesforce is 960 or, or 87 million, 222 that they've been paid.  
Speaker 6    00:53:16    That's what it says.  
Speaker 2    00:53:18    Um, and then it's got a GNA expense. What is  
Speaker 6    00:53:21    That general and administrator?  
Speaker 2    00:53:23    Right? 492 million.  
Speaker 6    00:53:26    Yes.  
Speaker 2    00:53:27    Uh,  
Speaker 6    00:53:28    Over how many years? 96 to 2005. So it's nine years. Am I counting correctly?  
Speaker 2    00:53:36    You are, then there is product liability and patent litigation, uh, expense. Um, you had, uh, OxyContin litigation expenses. Uh, then you have profit after all those are subtracted on OxyContin of 4 billion, 718 million. Is that correct?  
Speaker 6    00:53:58    That's that's what it says. I don't, I can't testify that it's correct, but that's what it says.  
Speaker 0    00:54:10    That was  
Speaker 2    00:54:12    Let's mark this as plaintiff's exhibit six.  
Speaker 0    00:54:17    I  
Speaker 6    00:54:23    Yep. It is marked. Do you want the original,  
Speaker 2    00:54:26    Um, I'm trying to go a little bit longer. I mean, if y'all need a break, we can take a break. I could take a break quick, take a break.  
Speaker 0    00:54:33    Yeah. That's good idea.  
Speaker 6    00:54:34    Do you want to shut down? Do I have to wait 10,  
Speaker 1    00:54:37    Second? Uh, we are off the record at 10:06 AM. We are back on the record at 10:18 AM  
Speaker 2    00:54:51    All. Um, this exhibit, I out, one more thing in exhibit four. And if you look at the second paragraph, there's a comment that says when discussing oxycodone, Aqua Contin, um, which is controlled release OxyContin, oxycodone. I'm  
Speaker 6    00:55:34    Sorry, just taught me out a little bit page what?  
Speaker 2    00:55:37    Uh, the first,  
Speaker 6    00:55:38    First page, page,  
Speaker 2    00:55:40    Uh, second paragraph.  
Speaker 6    00:55:42    Oh, okay.  
Speaker 2    00:55:43    It says the molecule lacks the stigma of morphine and maybe of particular advantage in the 5% approximately of patients who cannot be adequately treated with morphine. Um, was it your understanding that approximately 95% of the patients out there could be treated with Ms. Cotton?  
Speaker 6    00:56:09    No.  
Speaker 2    00:56:10    Um, do you disagree with that statement that I,  
Speaker 6    00:56:13    I do. I  
Speaker 2    00:56:15    Disagree. What percentage do you think of patients could be adequately treated with Ms. Common  
Speaker 6    00:56:24    Between 50 and 75%.  
Speaker 2    00:56:28    And what studies are you basing that on?  
Speaker 6    00:56:31    I'm basing it on general experience, uh, of being involved with MS. Contin at OxyContin since 1980. Okay.  
Speaker 2    00:56:41    Did you ever do any studies to determine, uh, what percentage of patients could be adequately treated with MS.  
Speaker 6    00:56:48    Contin? I don't remember any. Okay.  
Speaker 2    00:56:51    Did you ever do any studies on abuse liability for OxyContin before you all put it on the market?  
Speaker 6    00:57:00    I'm not aware of any,  
Speaker 2    00:57:02    Let me show you, um, what's been, uh, identified by Bates stamp, P D D 8 8 1 1 2 3 8 4 7. Copies of mark that we'll mark this plaintiff's exhibit seven. And I'll ask you if you can identify this,  
Speaker 0    00:57:28    Uh, may have a copy. Thank,  
Speaker 2    00:57:56    And does this appear to be a memo to you from Paul? Goldenheim  
Speaker 6    00:58:01    It? It is.  
Speaker 2    00:58:02    And who is Paul? Goldenheim  
Speaker 6    00:58:04    At the time he was head of research and development.  
Speaker 2    00:58:10    Okay. And just to kind of walk through this memo from the bottom down there, it looks like you had sent a memo, um, on March 14th of 97 to a number of individuals at, uh,  
Speaker 6    00:58:27    I'm looking for that. I'm looking for my oh, from me. Okay. I see that. Okay. I I'm, I'm sorry. I see. No, it's it's two emails. Okay. Thank you.  
Speaker 2    00:58:41    And the paragraph at the bottom says the B F a R M. What is that?  
Speaker 6    00:58:48    That was the German regulatory agency at that time  
Speaker 2    00:58:55    Says we're asked whether OxyContin could be classified as a controlled drug or whether it would be possible to obtain a relaxed status because of the difficulty in extracting oxycodone from the matrix. And the fact it was less liable to abuse because it was unknown. Um, so just dialing down on that first sentence, you were wondering whether oxycodone could be less regulated in Germany. Is that correct?  
Speaker 6    00:59:29    I believe that I was reporting something to Paul that I, I must have heard, but I was not involved in making any, any discussions or meetings with B Ram. Okay. Um, can I, may I just read the rest of it if we're gonna continue on this,  
Speaker 2    00:59:50    I'll tell you, I'll read it to you. Uh, the next sentence says the BFR, uh, B F a R M, which I understand is the German regulatory authority.  
Speaker 6    01:00:00    That's correct.  
Speaker 2    01:00:01    Answer that. Unfortunately, OxyContin would definitely be classified as a controlled drug for all strengths as is morphine. There could be no exception because of the controlled release protection, because there had been a few reports of abuse and there were limited data on long term use. Did I read that correctly?  
Speaker 6    01:00:24    You did.  
Speaker 2    01:00:25    Okay. And then you have here in caps, we have a lot of use data in the us with very, very, very few ad. What are AEs?  
Speaker 6    01:00:35    Those are reports to the agency, to the FDA, uh, and ad stands for adverse drug experience. All adverse drug experiences are reportable to the agency. Um, anything we are aware of, we must report periodically anybody else, however can also report Aedes to the agency. And so the agency maintains a catalog for every drug of ad.  
Speaker 2    01:01:15    Okay. And then you have in caps, uh, continuing, we can run another long-term trial to get more data. And if the abuse potential is equal or lower than with other non-scheduled drugs would Bera, unschedule it? That's your question? Correct. That  
Speaker 6    01:01:30    Was a  
Speaker 2    01:01:30    Question. And then Dr. Golden ham writes back on the subject of, is this an opening to descheduling the agent and descheduling means make it less restrictive, correct.  
Speaker 6    01:01:45    That that's how I would understand it. Okay.  
Speaker 2    01:01:49    Um, and if it's less restricted, uh, would you think that you could sell it to more people?  
Speaker 6    01:01:56    It would be easier for physicians to prescribe it? Um,  
Speaker 2    01:02:02    It's gonna increase sales  
Speaker 6    01:02:05    That is reasonable because they could prescribe it. If it were schedule three, instead of schedule two, as are some drugs, um,  
Speaker 2    01:02:18    And  
Speaker 6    01:02:18    Physicians could prescribe by telephone. Yeah.  
Speaker 2    01:02:22    And his response is we do not have any abuse liability studies. And this is as of 1997, correct?  
Speaker 6    01:02:30    That's correct.  
Speaker 2    01:02:31    Uh, to, to date, have you done abuse, liability studies?  
Speaker 6    01:02:35    Yes. Many.  
Speaker 2    01:02:36    When were they done?  
Speaker 6    01:02:40    I don't know when the first ones were done, but they were done repeatedly, uh, for many formulations, subsequently of both oxycodone and of other, uh, abusable opioids, both in control release form, and an immediate release form.  
Speaker 2    01:03:03    Have you done abuse, liability studies for OxyContin controlled release?  
Speaker 6    01:03:08    I don't, yes. The new, new formulations, definitely.  
Speaker 2    01:03:12    And when were those done?  
Speaker 6    01:03:14    I don't know exactly. Okay. But before the products were submitted to the agency,  
Speaker 2    01:03:20    You're saying the new formulation,  
Speaker 6    01:03:21    The new formulation.  
Speaker 2    01:03:22    Okay. When were the new formulation submitted?  
Speaker 6    01:03:26    I'm doing this from memory now about 2008. Okay. But I could be an error by a year or two.  
Speaker 2    01:03:34    So, um, uh, by 19 97, 2 years after this product was on the market, uh, he says we do not have any abuse liability studies. I think this is a dead end. Adding Naloxone, I think is the only possibility, but this is a difficult project from the clinical spec, uh, perspective we are investigating for hydrocodone. Um, and was that his response?  
Speaker 6    01:04:01    That is what he wrote.  
Speaker 2    01:04:03    He's basically saying they're not gonna correct schedule this  
Speaker 6    01:04:07    Unless perhaps they might, if it incorporated Naloxone  
Speaker 2    01:04:12    And Naloxone is an additive,  
Speaker 6    01:04:16    It is an, it is a reversal agent. It blocks the effect of opioids  
Speaker 2    01:04:24    And you all did not incorporate Naloxone. Correct.  
Speaker 6    01:04:28    We subsequently did in some markets, um, in Europe, in particular, and to some extent elsewhere,  
Speaker 2    01:04:38    Did they require you to do that?  
Speaker 6    01:04:39    No, we did it for another reason.  
Speaker 2    01:04:42    What was the reason  
Speaker 6    01:04:43    We discovered that it, it did not block the effect of the opioid apparently at all, but it did reduce the gastrointestinal side effects dramatically, including constipation, which is the most common side effect for any opioid.  
Speaker 0    01:05:09    All right.  
Speaker 6    01:05:14    I could add that. By the time we had a full press to develop abuse resistant form of OxyContin, we did do extensive work with another antagonist called naltrexone and naltrexone did when it got released, blocked the effect of the opioid. But unfortunately, after a huge investment, we could never be certain that it wouldn't be released when it was taken orally. It was almost perfect, but it had to be perfect because the agency said that if it released and blocked the effect of the opioid in patients, they would not approve it. And we could not reach perfection.  
Speaker 2    01:06:18    Let me show you an email chain. That's been produced mark. This that's wrong. Pull that off or not for sticks. And it's P PDD 2 9 5 2 0 8 0 6 4 3 9. And um, if you start at the back, I believe this email chain, um, begins at the back. And this is an email from you dated, um,  
Speaker 0    01:07:21    The last email, the first,  
Speaker 2    01:07:23    Yeah, the last email is the first email and the dated 3, 2 97.  
Speaker 6    01:07:30    Wait, I'm seeing 3 11 97 0 3, 2 90 is sort of a little out of order. Isn't it?  
Speaker 2    01:07:39    I'm sorry. Yeah, there is uh, my, my tore off, uh,  
Speaker 6    01:07:44    Okay. Oh, no,  
Speaker 2    01:07:46    3 12 97, 2 27 97 is the first.  
Speaker 0    01:07:51    Okay for you.  
Speaker 6    01:07:52    Pardon?  
Speaker 0    01:07:53    I highlighted the, the email. You  
Speaker 6    01:07:56    Okay.  
Speaker 0    01:07:57    What's the last  
Speaker 6    01:07:57    Page? 2 27. It's not, oh, you have that. It's the middle page for me. Not the last. Okay. Yep.  
Speaker 0    01:08:10    Can we, can we organize those that, yeah, I'm not sure that all the pages have been assembled properly.  
Speaker 6    01:08:15    Yeah.  
Speaker 8    01:08:16    These are the, this is the way this document was produced to us. Um, and the reason that there's a skip in the Bates range from the last two pages  
Speaker 2    01:08:27    Is  
Speaker 8    01:08:28    Purdue produced a totally random document in between it. But if you look at the Bates numbers of the original Bates stamp on this document, they're consecutive among those pages in a consecutive email chain. So I have taken the Liberty of removing the completely erroneous page that has nothing to do with this email chain and produced produces  
Speaker 9    01:08:51    Question about that. The question is he has a different formulation he's talking about.  
Speaker 8    01:08:55    No, he's got the same. Exactly.  
Speaker 10    01:08:56    We're just trying to make sure that we're all working from the same document  
Speaker 2    01:09:00    Here. So if you'll go to the 2 27 97 email,  
Speaker 6    01:09:06    That's it. Yeah, no, I had to look for it. I expected it at the end, but it wasn't okay. Yes.  
Speaker 2    01:09:14    It says, um, this is from Walter Wimmer at Mundy Pharma Germany. And that's a company that's owned by the Sackler family,  
Speaker 6    01:09:23    Correct? It  
Speaker 2    01:09:24    Is. And who's Walter  
Speaker 6    01:09:26    Wimmer. He was the general manager at that time.  
Speaker 2    01:09:30    And he says, um, dear Bob, um, first paragraph in the course of this conversation, he explained to you that due to his discussions with B F a R M, he does see a 50% chance to get OxyContin off the narcotic drug status provided. You could give some information on the very low abuse potential of our CR formulation. Did I read that correctly?  
Speaker 6    01:09:54    You did.  
Speaker 2    01:09:56    And then in response to that, if you go up to the top, Dr. Robert Keiko has an email dated 2 27 97.  
Speaker 6    01:10:04    He does.  
Speaker 2    01:10:05    And he says, while my thinking is still development developing, frankly, I'm very concerned and I would have to recommend against the uncontrolled, but monitored proposal at this time, parentheses perhaps if only to make sure the risks are appreciated and accepted before we proceed as proposed. Um, do you know what, uh, risk he was discussing?  
Speaker 6    01:10:30    I have no idea.  
Speaker 2    01:10:33    Did you ever discuss with him why he was recommending against, uh, going uncontrolled, but monitored with respect to Oxy?  
Speaker 6    01:10:40    I don't even know what it means. <laugh> all right. If I've read the rest of it, do you think it would give me a clue or I, I infer that you, because you didn't highlight it, you don't think it would, it would shed any light on what was meant above.  
Speaker 2    01:11:00    Well, let's read the rest of it. It might help. Um, he says under paragraph B, I don't believe we have a sufficiently strong case to argue that OxyContin has minimal or no abuse liability. And this is dated 1997, correct? Yes. He says in the us oxycodone containing products were once less controlled than now. Abuse resulted in greater controls. Um, is that accurate?  
Speaker 6    01:11:31    I believe it is.  
Speaker 2    01:11:33    Um, and what he's saying, there is these weren't as controlled at, at one time and they got abused and that's why we have controls now. Correct.  
Speaker 6    01:11:42    I believe that is the case.  
Speaker 2    01:11:44    He says oxycodone containing products are still among the most abused opioids in the us. This information is available to B F a R M the German regulators.  
Speaker 6    01:11:57    Um, I, that's certainly true that the information would be available  
Speaker 2    01:12:02    To them. And he says the local tissue necrosis that can result from injection of OxyContin fixed, uh, in quotations for such abuse is not likely to be a deterrent to abuse. Let us not forget that in New Zealand, MST is the most common sources of temporarily abused morphine slash heroin. And were you aware at that time that, uh, OxyContin, there was a concern that, that oxycodone opioids could be, uh, injected or abused?  
Speaker 6    01:12:36    I don't remember this memo. And I don't remember what, whether I had read the whole chain carefully or not.  
Speaker 2    01:12:45    And then he says  
Speaker 6    01:12:45    He even  
Speaker 2    01:12:46    Saw it. Then he says our dossier acknowledge. And by dossier, I assume he means the documents. Yes.  
Speaker 6    01:12:54    Purdue  
Speaker 2    01:12:55    Has. Yes. Our dossier acknowledges a small handful of patients in our research program. And that means studies you all were doing, is  
Speaker 6    01:13:03    That correct? That's, that's what I would understand it  
Speaker 2    01:13:06    To me who were suspect in terms of their drug accountability. Do you know if that was reported to anyone that, that U's dossier had a handful of patients who were suspect in terms of their drug accountability?  
Speaker 6    01:13:19    Uh, I don't know if it was reported, but I'm confident it was, if it was an FDA submitted trial, it would've been in either the safety summary or the, um, or the efficacy summary. Do you  
Speaker 2    01:13:38    Both, do you remember the issues with the Roth reprint, where there were patients who they determined, um, had withdrawal symptoms and that was not reported?  
Speaker 6    01:13:49    Objection, form.  
Speaker 2    01:13:51    I'm sorry. Are you, are you familiar with the Roth reprint?  
Speaker 6    01:13:53    No. No.  
Speaker 2    01:13:55    You know, whether that was part of the plea agreement that Purdue Frederick had when they pled guilty to a felony?  
Speaker 6    01:14:02    I don't, I don't recall.  
Speaker 2    01:14:08    And it says under paragraph C, um, oh, continuing on. We do not, we do not have a postmarketing abuse monitoring system and database from which we could conclude that diversion abuse is not occurring. Were you aware that you all put this on the market and, uh, OxyContin CR and did not have a post marketing abuse monitoring system or database from which you could tell whether abuse or diversion was occurring?  
Speaker 6    01:14:37    I was not aware of that. I don't believe it was a requirement at the time. I'm sure we would've fulfilled all the FDA requirements that they asked us.  
Speaker 2    01:14:48    Do you think it would've been a good idea before putting OxyContin controlled release on the market to have an abuse monitoring system and database from which to tell if it was being diverted or abused?  
Speaker 6    01:15:01    Absolutely. Yes.  
Speaker 2    01:15:03    And then under paragraph C, it says if OxyContin is uncontrolled in Germany, it is highly likely that it will eventually be abused there and then controlled. This may be more damaging to OxyContin internationally than any temporarily higher cells that could be gleaned from an uncontrolled status. Let us not forget the experience with Bupenorphine, which was initially uncontrolled reports of abuse in Germany, in part eventually led to lots of bad press and controlled status. Worldwide sales suffered even where Bupenorphine had already been controlled. So given the above, what do others have to offer that should prompt us to pursue the proposal for uncontrolled status for OxyContin, anywhere question mark. And was that, uh, the response of Robert Keiko?  
Speaker 6    01:15:55    It appears to be so,  
Speaker 2    01:15:56    And who was Robert Keiko?  
Speaker 6    01:15:58    He was in charge of the development program of OxyContin.  
Speaker 2    01:16:03    Was he the chief medical officer?  
Speaker 6    01:16:05    No, but he was, he was respected. His opinions were respected and were heated.  
Speaker 2    01:16:13    And then the next email, which comes from you is Dr. Richard, Richard Sackler at  
Speaker 6    01:16:20    Norwalk. Give me just a little time to find it since they're not in order, but okay. Norwalk. And could you read the date please?  
Speaker 2    01:16:32    Uh, it looks like it's 3, 2 19 97. Um, and there  
Speaker 6    01:16:36    3 12, 3, 12 97.  
Speaker 2    01:16:40    I'm looking at three, two, it says, oh, 2 0 3 97. But I think the way it's confused is really March 3rd.  
Speaker 6    01:16:48    Okay. I see something from three 12. I see something from 11 3 97.  
Speaker 2    01:17:02    It's page five. Maybe  
Speaker 6    01:17:03    That'll help. Oh, I don't think I have page. Oh, page five. Okay. Thank  
Speaker 2    01:17:06    You. And this is your response to Robert Keiko saying this is a bad idea for all these reasons. And you say, this is the first time I've heard of this idea. What makes us believe that we can accomplish it? Walter? How substantially would it improve your sales? And what you're talking about there is if we can get it uncontrolled in Germany, how substantially will it approve improve sales? Correct?  
Speaker 6    01:17:32    Yes. Yes. That was, it would appear that that's what my question  
Speaker 2    01:17:36    Was. Please give a five year projection with control and without does each member of the EU, is that European union? Yes. Decide this for themselves. Or would one lead if one would lead then is Denmark or Germany more likely to agree. And then Harry Kutzko of mul Mundy Pharma Mo Monday, Pharma writes you back on March 7th and says, dear Dr. Richard  
Speaker 6    01:18:09    A second, March 10th. So we're now on page one or two.  
Speaker 2    01:18:19    That's the same page, the one right above.  
Speaker 6    01:18:22    Okay. I'm sorry.  
Speaker 2    01:18:26    Please find stated below our five year projection of OxyContin without and with controls as requested mm-hmm  
Speaker 6    01:18:34    <affirmative>.  
Speaker 2    01:18:36    And it was projected that with first year nonnarcotic, uh, narcotic drug with control, be 3.000 TDM. Do you know what that is?  
Speaker 6    01:18:49    I assume, total or something Deutsch Marks something Deutsch  
Speaker 2    01:18:52    Marks. And that would be 3 million.  
Speaker 6    01:18:55    That would be my understanding  
Speaker 2    01:18:57    And then turnover over nonnarcotic drug and over non-narcotic drug without control is 10 million  
Speaker 6    01:19:03    The first year. Yes, first  
Speaker 2    01:19:04    Year. And on the fifth year, it was projected to be 18 million with control, but 30 million without control.  
Speaker 6    01:19:11    Correct. That's what it says.  
Speaker 2    01:19:15    And then you wrote back on 3, 8 97, right above that one. And it says, BK advised that the regulatory authorities did say,  
Speaker 6    01:19:25    Okay, BK, sorry. I heard DK. And,  
Speaker 2    01:19:29    And, uh, advised the regulatory authorities said that Oxy would be scheduled. And so would be under narcotic control. Does this correspond to your info? If so, if so, is this matter now closed or is there some appeal or other procedure you would want to consider? So you still saw the advantage of getting OxyContin CR uh, uncontrolled. Um, and we're wondering if there was some way you might appeal the German decision objection,  
Speaker 3    01:20:01    Form. That that's not what the statement says that you just read.  
Speaker 2    01:20:05    Well, correct me if I'm wrong there. Why did you say, is there some appeal or other procedure you want to consider? Um,  
Speaker 6    01:20:19    Okay. Uh, this whole experience is actually like reliving a third of my life. Um, and I had completely forgotten until I saw this document that Walter had been very hesitant to pursue the development or the marketing of OxyContin, because he didn't believe it would sell very well. He turned out to be completely wrong. And when it was introduced, it did extremely well. We were of the contrary opinion, but he said he came back and he did quite a bit of work without any reference to anybody else on determining or trying to get the B farm to consider de not scheduling it. And this whole stream was occasioned by that we, many of us in the us were not enthusiastic about not scheduling it in Germany. There is no equivalent, at least at that time that I recall of anything like schedule three, you were either an abusable drug.  
Speaker 6    01:21:41    And thus you had all the abusable drug controls, or you were not. And we were not in favor of this, but we were trying to be polite and solicitous rather than saying, this is a terrible idea. Forget it, don't do it because we still felt that with the controls, which we thought would be appropriate and were appropriate, obviously, um, it would still be very welcome, very useful to patients in the German market. So this whole stream, uh, this whole trail really was occasioned by that, but I don't remember anymore. So if we go on and we're gonna relive another few days of my life. Sure.  
Speaker 2    01:22:29    Let me ask you, if you thought controls were appropriate, why were you asking here raising the issue? If there was some appeal that could be taken  
Speaker 6    01:22:37    Just, just to be polite, not to just shut him down.  
Speaker 2    01:22:40    Okay. Well, let me ask you this. Let's go to the next one, which is page four. He writes back. Yes. Richard, this does correspond to the information given by Mr. G our registration office. We also attended the meeting with the BGA. This matter is now closed. There is no way of appeal. Is that what he told you?  
Speaker 6    01:22:59    That seems to be what he told me.  
Speaker 2    01:23:01    And then you wrote back and said, when we are next together, we should talk about how this idea was raised and why it failed to be realized. I thought that it was a good idea if it could be done. Was that your response to  
Speaker 6    01:23:16    That's what it said, but I didn't mean it. I just wanted to be encouraging. I was very glad it was closed  
Speaker 2    01:23:31    Up at the top. There's a note. Uh, there's another response from Walter Wimmer, um, who says to get the product off narcotic drug status, it would be possible to combine oxycodone with Naloxone provided the development cost. Weren't too high that was sent on three  
Speaker 6    01:23:51    12. Okay. Let me, boom.  
Speaker 2    01:23:55    Okay. And then the top one is cut off. I'm sorry, but it says Paul, Michael, would this be a feasible approach here in the us? I don't know of any C2 narcotic. That is descheduled when Naloxone is added to you, that is that a question you were raising?  
Speaker 6    01:24:13    It looks like I raised it just as a matter of information, as I said, they eventually did develop that product. Uh, and it was extremely successful, but at the time they researched it, they quickly discovered that Naloxone didn't, they achieve the desired blocking effect, but they made another discovery that was even more valuable.  
Speaker 0    01:25:32    Hmm.  
Speaker 2    01:25:37    Oh. Um, would I be correct that Purdue Pharma never conducted or retained anyone to conduct studies regarding addiction and physical dependency rates of oxycodone products? Um, <affirmative> at least as of March 4th, 2002,  
Speaker 6    01:26:26    I don't know the answer.  
Speaker 2    01:26:30    Are you aware that counsel for Purdue Pharma, um, answered interrogatories that requested the names of all individuals retained by Purdue Pharma to do studies regarding addiction and physical dependency rates of OxyContin products and copies of all studies. And he answered, we never conducted or retained anyone to conduct studies regarding addiction and physical dependency rates of Oxycon code on products.  
Speaker 3    01:26:58    Mr. Thompson, if you're reading from a document, could you show it to the witness?  
Speaker 2    01:27:03    Uh, no. I'm just asking him if he's aware of it. Cause I'm trying to move the deposition along. So are you aware of that?  
Speaker 6    01:27:09    No. I'm not aware of his, his statement.  
Speaker 2    01:27:21    Are you aware of any studies conducted or retained or anyone being retained to conduct studies regarding addiction and physical dependency rates of oxycodone products prior to 2002?  
Speaker 6    01:27:34    I I'm not aware of any or I don't remember any,  
Speaker 2    01:27:40    You got these,  
Speaker 0    01:27:42    You already introduced those  
Speaker 6    01:27:48    In 2002. I was the president of Purdue Pharma and this would not have necessar, this wouldn't have required my, uh, approval or knowledge, unless it was, it led to something that was surprising or important and unexpected.  
Speaker 2    01:28:23    No, I still won't ask about this. Did this,  
Speaker 3    01:28:26    Mr. Thompson, uh, did you put in the again exhibit number to the last document that we were discussing, which was a series of emails?  
Speaker 2    01:28:34    It was eight.  
Speaker 3    01:28:35    Eight. Okay. Thank  
Speaker 0    01:28:36    You.  
Speaker 2    01:28:46    It's OxyContin product two. All right. I'm gonna switch and ask you a little bit about the OxyContin project team. And this is a memo dated December 14th, 1993, PD D 95 25 0 9 3 5 6. And there's a few paragraphs I want to try to cover here. If you will look at the bulletin points on the front page, the second one from the bottom says marketing OxyContin tablets will be marketed against Percocet and Duragesic the OxyContin line may replace our MS. Contin line if MSC generics are competing. Is that correct?  
Speaker 6    01:29:36    That's correct.  
Speaker 2    01:29:37    Okay. And that's not the, uh, is that the malignant cancer group of patients or is that, uh, non-malignant cancer group of patients?  
Speaker 6    01:29:48    I'm sorry. Objection  
Speaker 3    01:29:48    To the form. I, I don't understand the question.  
Speaker 2    01:29:52    All right. You may answer  
Speaker 0    01:29:57    MS.  
Speaker 6    01:29:59    Contin, as I said before, was used in treating both cancer patients and non-cancer patients, and there was no focus I don't believe or consideration in this statement of whether it would be both. I think,  
Speaker 2    01:30:19    Do you have a knowledge of what Percocet and Duragesic was used mostly to treat  
Speaker 6    01:30:26    Percocet and Percocet was an extremely, um, okay. Widely used product used to treat, uh, both short and long term pain conditions, both nonmalignant and malignant.  
Speaker 2    01:30:49    And then if you'll turn over to, um, paragraph 2.3, and this is 1993, um, it says abuse, toxic benchtop study the results of a spoon.  
Speaker 6    01:31:22    Okay. I see. 2.3, you said yes. Thank you.  
Speaker 2    01:31:26    The results of a spoon and shoot study have been sent to the FDA. What was the spoon and shoot study?  
Speaker 6    01:31:32    I, I don't know. I could guess, but I don't know.  
Speaker 2    01:31:39    Um, was that a study done to determine if, uh, the drug could be abused by extracting oxycodone from the tablet?  
Speaker 6    01:31:54    It's a reasonable guess, but I don't know the details of what that study was.  
Speaker 2    01:32:00    And then under 3.2, the last sentence says a crush tablet study may be conducted if we decide such a study is needed. Do you know if you ever decided such a study was needed?  
Speaker 6    01:32:11    What's the number on that? I'd just like to read it  
Speaker 2    01:32:14    3.2 last  
Speaker 6    01:32:16    Sentence. I'm sorry. Thank you. 3.2.  
Speaker 0    01:32:23    Okay.  
Speaker 6    01:32:42    Yes. Okay. I read that. I don't know if such a study was done.  
Speaker 0    01:32:47    Okay.  
Speaker 2    01:32:54    And then on 5.4, the very last sentence says Mike Innerato. And was he a guy in charge of marketing?  
Speaker 6    01:33:11    No, he was, he worked in the marketing department, but he was not at this time. He was not in charge. He was a middle manager in marketing.  
Speaker 2    01:33:21    All right. It says, uh, Mike Innerato asked if we had any quality of life questions in our ongoing studies. Robert reader stated that we did not, but that we could include quality of life questions and future studies.  
Speaker 0    01:33:35    Um,  
Speaker 2    01:33:39    Do you know if quality of life questions were included?  
Speaker 6    01:33:44    I believe there were studies later that included quality of life measures, but I am not certain of that. Um, I am certain it would've been favorable, but I'm not certain just what studies were or were not done.  
Speaker 2    01:34:06    Yeah. Let's mark that as zip been marked yet exhibit nine, with respect to oxycodone and morphine. Um, do you know, um, whether OxyContin is more powerful or less powerful a drug than morphine?  
Speaker 6    01:35:12    It depends what you mean by powerful.  
Speaker 2    01:35:16    Um, I think Dr. Is it good? Goldenheim yes. Was he an employee of,  
Speaker 6    01:35:25    Yes.  
Speaker 2    01:35:26    I think he testified that that OxyContin was twice as strong as morphine. Is that your understanding?  
Speaker 6    01:35:33    If and if, if the question, if powerful means potency, absolutely. It is twice as potent as morphine. And we were very proud that we discovered this, um, first in animal studies and then in human studies and we made it widely known, um, perhaps even before the drug was introduced, but certainly in the package, in certain all the promotional material.  
Speaker 2    01:36:08    Do you know how many doctors or what percentage of doctors thought that it was equal to or less strong than morphine?  
Speaker 6    01:36:16    I would assume very few if they, if they were promoted to, uh, I can't believe that they wouldn't have understood that formed the basis of our recommendations of dosing, of the strength of the tablets that were developed. Um, and in fact, it was consistent with physician's own experience with Percocet, where they would administer a five milligram dose, uh, and they, if they used morphine, they knew that five milligrams of morphine would achieve very little pain belief if given orally, perhaps somewhat more of given by injection.  
Speaker 2    01:37:09    Let's mark this as plaintiff's exhibit 10. This is the, um, a memo dated 1992, August 10th, oxycodone project team meeting minutes.  
Speaker 6    01:37:37    I'm sorry, August 10th.  
Speaker 2    01:37:39    And it is PDD 9 5 2 1 4 1 0 3 2 9 3 9.  
Speaker 6    01:37:45    I have three. Oh, the first page is three nine. Correct.  
Speaker 2    01:37:53    And if you'll look at this, it says a literature search, the second paragraph, a literature search on oxycodone and oxymorphone. Just a second is being conducted.  
Speaker 6    01:38:04    I'm sorry. This is just not very clear. Give me a second. The issue, a literature search. I, are we looking at the same page?  
Speaker 2    01:38:12    No, you're not. You're on page two. I'm on page one. Oh,  
Speaker 6    01:38:14    I'm sorry. I thought you said August 10th. Okay. This one is August 4th. Okay.  
Speaker 2    01:38:21    I'm sorry. Second paragraph. A literature search on oxycodone and oxymorphone is being conducted by one of the summer employees. Um, um, do you know who was doing the literature search initially?  
Speaker 6    01:38:35    No. It would've been a son or daughter of one of the people who work for Purdue fifth Frederick or Purdue Pharma.  
Speaker 2    01:38:47    Fifth paragraph down second sentence says the current consideration is to develop 20, 40, 80 and 160 milligram tablet. In addition to the 10 milligram tablet now in the clinic. And whose idea was it to develop? Uh, 20, 40, 80 and 160 milligram tablets. I'm sorry,  
Speaker 6    01:39:06    Which page  
Speaker 0    01:39:07    Are you reading?  
Speaker 2    01:39:10    First page. Just what I called out. Fourth paragraph. Second sentence.  
Speaker 0    01:39:17    Okay. Thank you.  
Speaker 6    01:39:19    This was a team decision. It was discussed extensively.  
Speaker 2    01:39:27    And then if you'll go to the second page, um, first paragraph, it says with regard to the package insert and the first year advertising claims, it was discussed with that. Mr. Cigar should meet with others and rework the quote draft package insert the purpose would be to idealize the insert and coordinate the contents with the advertising claims and clinical trials program. The package insert should include comparative claims. It must be kept in mind. This is a working document. Why did you want to, uh, coordinate the package, insert with your advertising? Claims  
Speaker 6    01:40:09    The package insert is the Bible for the product. It is the core document from which all promotion or communication with physicians, um, is to be based. It is typical in the industry that a lot of work is expended to make the package insert as comprehensive and complete as possible.  
Speaker 0    01:40:46    Right.  
Speaker 2    01:41:01    And this is a, you talked about physicians being aware of, uh, OxyContin being, uh, twice as strong as morphine a second ago. Let me hand you let's mark this as exhibit 11. This is an email. It says the author is doc. May  
Speaker 0    01:41:41    I have a copy? Oh, I'm  
Speaker 2    01:41:43    Sorry. In front of you says the author is Dr. Richard Richard Sackler at Norwalk dated 5 28 97. Uh, are you familiar with this email to Michael Friedman? Yes, who's Michael Friedman.  
Speaker 6    01:41:55    He was head of marketing and  
Speaker 2    01:41:57    Sales. Okay. And let's drop down and see what Michael Friedman has written. Uh, first paragraph, he says, my purpose in writing this memorandum is to clarify our position on the very complex issues raised by Mike CU during the phase four team meeting in which we're the subject of Dr. Richards inquiry. When they say Dr. Richards, who's that?  
Speaker 6    01:42:25    That  
Speaker 2    01:42:25    Was me. All right. First paragraph, we are well aware of the view held by many physicians that oxycodone is weaker than morphine. We also that this is the result of their association of oxycodone with less serious pain syndromes. This Associa and drones, this association arises from their extensive experience with and use of oxycodone combinations  
Speaker 2    01:42:53    To treat pain arising from a diverse set of causes, some serious, but most less serious. This quote personality of oxycodone is an integral part of the quote personality. Um, this personality of oxycodone is an integral part of the personality of OxyContin. When we launched OxyContin, we init intentionally avoided a probation promotional theme that would link OxyContin to cancer pain. We specifically linked OxyContin to the oxycodone combinations with our old way new way campaign. We made sure our initial detail piece provided reps with the opportunity to sell the product for a number of different pain states. With all of this, we were still concerned that the drug would be slotted for cancer pain, and we would encounter resistance in the non-malignant pain market and says our pricing of the product was geared toward the nonmalignant market. We knew if we priced low per milligram for the higher dose cancer patient, we would be priced way too low per milligram for the standard nonmalignant pain patient, where we really wanted to make a market. We feared that the cancer pain experts would object to the two to one ratio. And that two to one ratio is the ratio of oxycodone OxyContin to morphine. Is that correct?  
Speaker 6    01:44:23    Actually, if you want to strictly understand the ratio, the two to one would refer to the ratio of morphine to oxycodone.  
Speaker 2    01:44:36    Okay.  
Speaker 6    01:44:36    Right. Not the other way around. All right. That's what you, I know. That's what you meant to say.  
Speaker 2    01:44:41    Yes. Yes. Uh, and resulting cost of therapy for high dose patients. However, we had no choice given our position for OxyContin in any case we're developing hydromorphone.  
Speaker 6    01:44:55    I've lost you here. Okay. In any case,  
Speaker 2    01:44:58    We're developing  
Speaker 6    01:45:00    You in now  
Speaker 2    01:45:00    For the high dose patient,  
Speaker 6    01:45:03    Right. Okay. I'm at the end of paragraph four.  
Speaker 2    01:45:06    And then it says, despite our initial uncertainty we've been successful beyond our expectations in the nonmalignant pain market. Yes. And nonmalignant pain market is sort of the chronic, uh, arthritis back pain. Um, those types of patients.  
Speaker 6    01:45:23    Well, it, it, it, those are most typically moderate pain patients. Some of them may be severe, but there are many less common conditions that produce severe crippling life destroying pain. And we had an indication and still have for all pain states that are appropriately treatable with opioids for an extended period of time. We want it. So nonmalignant really is a distinction, all pain, other than the pain directly caused by the encroachment and destruction of tumor tissue in the patient  
Speaker 2    01:46:12    Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And then he says here,  
Speaker 2    01:46:20    Doctors use the drug in nonmalignant pain because it is effective. And the personality of OxyContin is less threatening to them and their patients than that, of the morphine alternatives. I apologize for this unspecific term, but I feel it captures the notion that there are image related attributes that influence drug acceptance. While we might wish to see more of this product sold for cancer pain, it would be extremely dangerous at this early stage in the life of the product to tamper with this quote personality to make physicians think the drug is stronger or equal to morphine. We are better off expanding use of OxyContin in the nonmalignant pain states and waiting for hydromorphone in 1999 to relaunch into cancer pain. Why was it felt that there would be a danger? Uh, it would be extremely dangerous at the early stage in the life of this product to tamper with this quote personality to make physicians think the drug is stronger or equal to morphine.  
Speaker 6    01:47:27    The context of this was as you know, a thread of emails that actually he alludes to. I started, um, the whole context and the whole discussion of Mr. Friedman here and in other I'll I'll pause here. No, go ahead. Because I think it's really important for you to understand this. The whole context was not to  
Speaker 6    01:48:02    The context was not to stigmatize oxycodone in a way that morphine was stigmatized. Morphine was seen as an end of life, extreme duress patient and extreme duress, often dying of cancer, but not only cancer, it was reserved by most physicians, if it was used at all, even when patients were in serious, severe, or even crippling pain, because telling a patient, um, I'm gonna put you on morphine. I'm gonna prescribe morphine for you. Uh, now we got to use morphine. However, the physician told the patient it often was associated with a death sentence. Oh, thinks the patient he's telling me I'm gonna die. Even worse. My doctor's putting me on morphine. He's giving up on me. We didn't want oxycodone to, to change the, as he says, personality of oxycodone, but you could say all the associated feelings of oxycodone, which were generally appropriate to a narcotic. We didn't want that to be polluted by all of the bad associations that patients and health caregivers had with morphine.  
Speaker 2    01:49:55    Did you think that if physicians thought it was stronger or equal to morphine, um, much less, twice as strong as morphine, that they would be less likely to write prescriptions and sales of OxyContin would go down?  
Speaker 6    01:50:10    No, uh, if it, if its personality was changed, if it was stigmatized as an end of life drug, it could limit its usefulness. The term stronger here meant more threatening, more frightening. There is no way that this intended or had the effect of causing physicians to overlook the fact that it was twice as potent. It was called out in virtually every promotional piece of literature. It was reflected in a conversion chart, which we had developed for the few patients who were being treated with morphine, where we made it very clear. If they're on any dose daily dose of morphine, you cut that dose in half for OxyContin. Um, and every action we took before the product was launched with the FDA in the package, insert in promotion and in all detailing emphasized that it was twice as strong. Some physicians had formed their own impression that it wasn't twice as strong. It was less strong. And we insisted that they observe, we said with this drug doctor, it is twice as strong, even when they said, no, I think it's one and a half times as strong. And some physicians even said, I think it's about the same potency as morphine. We would insist, no, please use it the way we have researched it. And the way the FDA has approved it now. And I think we were effective in getting that message across in time to most eventually almost all physicians.  
Speaker 2    01:52:14    This is 19 97, 2 years after the launch of OxyContin controlled release, correct? Yes. So it's been on the market now, uh, over, uh, well, you launched of January 96, we're now in may of 97. And it says we are well aware of the view held by many physicians that oxycodone is weaker than morphine. And, and the conclusion of this was, um, I do not plan to do anything about that. And you wrote back and said, I agree with you. Is there a general agreement or are there some holdouts? And was that what you wrote up at the top  
Speaker 6    01:52:53    Of the I did. And I agreed with him then, and I agreed with him now because I knew what he meant. And so did everybody else know, knew what he meant and more important. Our actions in promoting that twice as potent as morphine never wavered, we never disguised it or hit it. We emphasized it.  
Speaker 2    01:53:15    Okay. So you weren't doing this because the pain market for non-malignant pain was a much greater market share. Is that your  
Speaker 6    01:53:23    Testimony? No, no. That isn't, uh, we, the, we wanted to address both markets, the email, which perhaps you want to explore or not that started. This was, as he says in the first paragraph, something that I had inquired about and what I had inquired about was an error on my part. When we, before we launched OxyContin, we thought that our sales would be about equally divided between cancer, pain, and nonmalignant pain. We knew that the market for nonmalignant pain was much larger. Of course, fortunately for all of us, cancer is not as much less common than other pain states, but we had expected, it would be about 50 50. I had seen some reporter that attended a meeting where I learned it was about 20% of our sales. And thus, I wrote to Michael and said, why, what what's going on here? Why aren't we getting more cancer sales?  
Speaker 2    01:54:34    Let's let's let's look at the, the email you wrote to Michael co at Norwalk. Let's mark this as plaintiff's exhibit 12.  
Speaker 0    01:54:48    This one.  
Speaker 6    01:54:49    Yes. Sorry.  
Speaker 2    01:54:50    And Michael Colin writes, uh, on June 2nd of 97. And that was after the email we were just looking at and says in recent team meetings, we've discussed the issue that OxyContin is perceived by some physicians, particularly oncologists as not being as strong as MS. Contin now oncologists are cancer.  
Speaker 6    01:55:16    Yes.  
Speaker 2    01:55:16    Doctors, correct? Yes. So even the cancer doctors don't think that OxyContin is, uh, as strong as MS. Contin object object, according to this, correct? Objection  
Speaker 3    01:55:26    To the form. That's not what this  
Speaker 2    01:55:29    Says. Oh, well, let me rephrase it. Uh, you, you were aware or at least Michael CU was advising you that OxyContin is perceived by some physicians, particularly oncologists as not being as strong as MS. Contin, is that correct?  
Speaker 6    01:55:44    That's what the words  
Speaker 2    01:55:45    Say. And he says, although this perception has had some effect with physicians switching to Ms. Cotton with more severe cancer pain patient, it has actually had a positive effect with physicians use in non-cancer pain. And there he's saying non-cancer physicians that don't think it's as strong as MS. Contin we're having a positive effect from that. And I'm assuming he's talking about cells, wouldn't you?  
Speaker 6    01:56:10    Yes.  
Speaker 2    01:56:11    He says, since oxycodone is perceived as being a weaker opioid than morphine, it has resulted in OxyContin being used much earlier for non-cancer pain. Physicians are positioning this product where Percocet, hydrocodone and Tylenol with coding have been traditionally used. So he's saying here, physicians are using it because they think it's weaker than morphine, correct?  
Speaker 6    01:56:36    He's using the word weaker, but not meaning less potent than morphine within at this time, it appears that people had fallen into a habit of signifying less, frightening, less threatening, more patient acceptable as under the rubric of weaker or more frightening, more, less acceptable, um, and less desirable under the rubric or words stronger. But we knew that that the word weaker did not mean less potent. We knew that the word stronger did not mean more potent. And we knew that because by this time surely anybody who was using this product recognized it was more potent. They knew it was more potent. So it's very unfortunate for your understanding as well as anybody else's understanding that, that all those issues of the stigma of morphine, of the frightening nature of morphine, of morphine being a cancer drug end of life drug, it's a very unfortunate for your understanding. And for most people's understanding that the word weaker and stronger was used. We understood what it meant.  
Speaker 2    01:58:07    We're we're not done reading it yet, but let me ask you this. You were advised by your senior, um, employees that physicians perceived OxyContin controlled release as less strong than morphine. Uh, many physicians perceived it that way. Uh, correct  
Speaker 6    01:58:29    Words used, but didn't mean that they believed it was less potent because I knew they believed it was more potent. Their own practice proved that they recognized it was more potent. As I said before, Percocet was five milligrams.  
Speaker 2    01:58:47    Did you do any studies yourself or conduct any investigation to determine what percentage of physicians believe that OxyContin controlled release was less powerful than morphine? And we're, we're not aware it was twice as strong as  
Speaker 6    01:59:03    Morphine. You're talking about less potent.  
Speaker 2    01:59:05    Yes.  
Speaker 6    01:59:06    I don't know of such studies, but in common parlance and discussions with physicians, if really a substantial, if, if any substantial number of them believed, believed in the AR believed in an, had a erroneous belief, excuse me, if any, held an erroneous belief and said to a representative, oh, this is, this stuff is, is less potent than morphine. The salesman was had ample materials to demonstrate the physician that he was in error and was instructed to use those and did use it. And I wish we had a survey, had done a survey to demonstrate it in retrospect, but it was so generally the accepted that it was at least one and a half times more, more potent by even the skeptics, most skeptics. And there weren't many, but generally recognized to be twice as potent as morphine. It just never occurred to us.  
Speaker 2    02:00:15    Sure. And it's your belief that your sales force was telling these physicians that, uh, it's actually twice as strong as morphine and correcting that misperception that they  
Speaker 6    02:00:23    Had? Absolutely. It was in the package, insert the promotion in the conversion tables and in the recommended dosing, which  
Speaker 2    02:00:32    So promotional pieces, your symposiums, your review articles, your studies would all point that out.  
Speaker 6    02:00:38    I can't say that that everyone would point it out in every page, but it should have been right. An important part of, of most promotional  
Speaker 2    02:00:50    Materials. Well, well, let's read the rest of Michael Collins, um, email dated 6, 2 97. Well, after the launch of OxyContin, paragraph three says since the non-cancer pain market is much greater than the cancer pain market, it is important that we allow this product to be positioned where it currently is in the physician's mind. If we stress the power of OxyContin versus morphine, it may help us in the smaller cancer pain market, but hurt us in the larger, larger potential non-cancer pain market. Some physicians may start positioning this product where morphine is used and wait until the pain is severe before using it. Marketing has decided that, and by that they're talking about the marketing group, correct?  
Speaker 6    02:01:42    The marketing department.  
Speaker 2    02:01:43    Yes. Yeah. Marketing department. So it says marketing has decided that the effects of the phase four team should be predominantly focused on expanding OxyContin use for non-cancer pain. And then if you look at the last paragraph, it says it is important that we'd be careful not to change the perception of physicians toward oxycodone when developing promotional pieces, symposia, review articles, studies, et cetera. And what they're talking about there is let's not clear up this misconception that physicians have that OxyContin is, um, not as strong as in S Contin,  
Speaker 3    02:02:25    Correct? I object to the form of the question, Mr. Thompson, you in reading this skipped over two sentences, I asked that you go back and read this with the two sentences that you omitted the born beginning with the sales force can teach the oncologist.  
Speaker 2    02:02:43    Oh sure. Our approach to cancer pain will be to get physicians to use it earlier. Instead of products such as Percocet, Vicodin, or Tylenol three, the sales force can teach the oncologist the proper dose and titrate OxyContin to ensure that they stay with it as the pain increases. Now, oncologists are the cancer pain doctors, correct? That doesn't say anything about all the nonmalignant, uh, doctors, all the doctors that treat nonmalignant pain. Correct.  
Speaker 6    02:03:13    But they would be taught the same thing how to titrate, because that was the, that was in a sense, the fundamental doctrine of treating pain with opioids start low and titrate.  
Speaker 2    02:03:29    And, uh, well,  
Speaker 6    02:03:30    Just the dose in other words, upward  
Speaker 2    02:03:32    It, well, the whole purpose of this email is that you not teach the nonmalignant pain physicians. That OxyContin is, uh, twice as strong as morphine and let them continue with their perception that it's not correct.  
Speaker 6    02:03:47    No, not correct.  
Speaker 2    02:03:49    Well, let's, let's continue reading the rest of it. Then. Um, last paragraph, it is important that we be careful not to change the perception of physicians toward oxycodone when developing promotional pieces, symposia, review articles, studies, etc. Now, et cetera. Now, am I correct? That what he's saying in here is let's not clear up the misperception in any of our promotional pieces, symposia review articles or studies  
Speaker 6    02:04:18    Don't change the personality. Don't change this to an end of life, cancer drug to a drug that shouldn't be used except at the end of life. Uh, when everything else has been exhausted, that was the thrust. I may just add something here. There's a conflation within this, which you wouldn't understand. And that was when, in the first paragraph, which you read where he said that oncologists think it isn't as strong as Ms. Cotton here. The meaning that we understood, certainly I understood. And anybody who was involved was the cancer doctors who were using the drug were stopping at, they had established emotionalized list, notional idea based on their past habit of using Percocet, that they shouldn't go above 40 to 60 milligrams a day of oxycodone. And the reason they developed that habit, that practice limit was not because of the oxycodone. It was because of the Tylenol, which was the more toxic agent in that combination.  
Speaker 6    02:05:42    You're probably aware that recently the FDA has recommended lowering the maximum daily Tylenol dose from four grams a day to three. And, but even then four grams a day was recognized as being the, the then practical limit. So oncologists who were using oxycodone as Percocet were just in the habit, well, you're getting 40 milligrams a day of oxycodone. Your pain is coming back rather than titrate those patients to a higher OxyContin level. They said, well, we gotta switch to something else. And that was really what was going on. And in part, why oncologists use of the product had not developed as well as we had wished that it would develop. And that was understood and contained within this dialogue. Not all of it documented here.  
Speaker 2    02:06:47    Yeah. Sure. Well, let's go back and talk about it a little bit more then. So in the first paragraph, he says, we've discussed the issue that OxyContin is perceived by some physicians, particularly oncologists as not being as strong as MS. Contin. Although this perception has had some effect with physicians, switching to MS. Contin with the more severe cancer pain, um, it has actually had a positive effect with physicians use and non-cancer pain. So what he's saying there, if I'm reading this correctly, is that because they think it is, uh, not as strong as Ms. Cotton, when they need a strong drug for cancer pain patients, some of the physicians aren't switching to it because they don't think it's as strong and that may hurt sales a little bit there, but with the non-cancer pain where you don't want as strong a drug as an end of life, malignant cancer pain patient might need, it's actually helping ourselves that they have this misperception because they are going ahead and prescribing it because they don't think it's as strong as Ms. Cotton, that it is that what that first paragraph is saying.  
Speaker 6    02:07:55    You're, that's what the words say. But the meaning of strong here would be effective. It is not as effective. And the reason they thought it was not as effective is they had a mental notion of a limit and they didn't follow the doctrine of titrating increasing the dose when the pain is getting worse. And all of this was, was really known. I mean, by 1997, most of the people who disagreed and thought that OxyContin was not two to one, they thought it was one and a half to one that was by far the most common objection, still stronger than morphine, but not quite as much stronger as we said it was, they had been persuaded if they used the drug. Oh yes. Particularly, uh, those oncologists who switched from MS. Contin to OxyContin.  
Speaker 2    02:08:58    So then he says, since oxycodone is perceived as being weaker, opioid than morphine, it has resulted in OxyContin being used much earlier for non-cancer pain. Correct. So he's saying more people are using it earlier for non-cancer pain. Cause they think it's weaker,  
Speaker 6    02:09:17    Not, not less potent, um, more acceptable to the patient, not frightening, not stigmatized as morphine unfairly was by history. Um, that was the meaning. And I've lost my thought here. Could you just repeat your question so I can finish my answer?  
Speaker 2    02:09:40    Sure. And what he's saying here is the non-cancer pain doctors, which is the much bigger market share when you're trying to sell OxyContin is the nonmalignant pain market. It's actually helping cells there cuz they don't think it's as strong as  
Speaker 6    02:09:53    Morphine. Again, as I've testified before the term stronger and weaker. Was it an very unfortunate term you  
Speaker 2    02:10:03    Wanna use effective  
Speaker 6    02:10:05    In the case of here effective? Yes. In the case of cancer because they were using it. Let me explain one other thing. Um, at the time that this product was introduced, the world health organization had promulgated a step ladder approach to cancer pain. And when OxyContin was introduced, we properly with the agreement of the FDA said that Emma, uh, that OxyContin was appropriate for the second step and the third step that's where the start with and stay with theme came from. Um, so, uh, I, I, I know that this could cause real confusion reading these documents if you're not involved day to day, but there is no way that any of the people on these documents understood stronger to mean less, more potent weaker to mean less potent. We had never departed from a strong promotional theme that it was twice as strong as morphine.  
Speaker 2    02:11:37    Yeah. And then down at the bottom, he says, or let's take the middle paragraph since the non-cancer pain market is much greater than the cancer pain market. Is it important? We allow this product to be positioned where it currently is in the physician's mind. And that means, let 'em believe that, um, OxyContin controlled release is not as effective as morphine.  
Speaker 6    02:12:03    No. I said the effectiveness really applied to the oncologists who were saying, ah, this isn't as effective. Or I, you know, I have to, you know, when the pain pain gets really bad, I switch 'em to something else. And that was the one place or the one circumstance in which we would've understood it as effective. And I've explained that we believe that that was a consequence of them just having a mental limit.  
Speaker 2    02:12:31    Sure. He says, if we stress the quote power of OxyContin in quote versus morphine, and that is, uh, it may help us in the smaller cancer pain market that him know that it is more powerful than morphine that'll help in the smaller cancer pain market. Correct.  
Speaker 6    02:12:50    That's what he says.  
Speaker 2    02:12:51    Yeah. But hurt us in the larger potential non-cancer pain market. Some physicians, physicians may start positioning this product where morphine is used and wait until pain is severe before using it.  
Speaker 6    02:13:05    Well then he's coming back probably to the cancer market. I'm not sure, but,  
Speaker 2    02:13:11    And in,  
Speaker 6    02:13:11    We always said it was a powerful drug. We implied that we didn't use the words because words can elicit a whole variety of responses.  
Speaker 2    02:13:24    And then the marketing department has decided that the efforts of the phase four team should be predominantly focused on expanding OxyContin use for non-cancer pain. Right. Right. That's the, that's the group that if you clear up the misperception may be less likely to prescribe according to what he's written here. Correct.  
Speaker 6    02:13:43    If you change the, if you change the character of the drug in their mind, if you tell them it's a cancer drug it's for end of life care, yes. You might change their perception. We didn't believe that that was appropriate nor did the FDA, nor did the opinion. Leaders believe it was appropriate. It truly was a drug that an appropriate doses could manage moderate and severe and extremely severe pain where patients needed an opioid to manage their pain. It's important also that you understand that for a hundred years. And even today, there is no drug that is more effective or safer than opioids for treating pain over the long term. And it was a shame that when that for, for decades, no opioid was used, uh, in many, most perhaps overwhelming majority of patients who had severe pain.  
Speaker 2    02:15:07    Do, do you think it might compromise patient care if Purdue Pharma allowed patients, uh, physicians to believe that the drug they are prescribing them is weaker than morphine.  
Speaker 6    02:15:25    Could you just repeat the question? Yeah. I just want to get the, the  
Speaker 2    02:15:28    Question. Do you think it might compromise patient care? If Purdue Pharma was aware that many physicians felt like, um, OxyContin was weaker than morphine and did nothing to clear up that misconception?  
Speaker 6    02:15:46    No. If they believed it was less potent than morphine, we clearly cleared up that misconception. We told them it was twice as potent. We told them to use doses that were considerably lower than the morphine doses that they might have been accustomed to. What we didn't want to do is to turn this into a cancer drug.  
Speaker 2    02:16:10    Right. And this is 1997. That's correct. Well, after the launch, well, after your package insert has been put out and all that, correct? Yes. And, and you and Michael CU says it is important that we be careful not to change the perception of physicians toward oxycodone when developing promotional pieces, symposia, review articles, studies, et cetera. Correct. Is that what he wrote?  
Speaker 6    02:16:35    Looks like that's what he wrote  
Speaker 2    02:16:38    And you replied to him and did not say no, we need to clear up this misconception immediately. What you said is I think that you have this issue well in hand that's, if there are developments, please let me know.  
Speaker 6    02:16:52    That's what I said. But the misconception that you're referring to didn't exist. The misconception that this was a benign, um, harmless, weak drug for treating pain was not the perception that existed. So that was not the error that he was. I don't know quite what he, let me just read what he said here. Where were you reading from please? We've gone through this a number of times. So where were you reading from here?  
Speaker 2    02:17:39    We were reading from, uh,  
Speaker 6    02:17:41    You just read me something from,  
Speaker 2    02:17:43    From your top where you said, I think that  
Speaker 6    02:17:45    You have this well hand, but where you said I was responding, where was that?  
Speaker 2    02:17:51    Where he says it is important that we be careful not to change the perception of physicians toward oxycodone when developing promotional pieces, symposia, review articles or studies.  
Speaker 6    02:18:00    That's correct. Not change the character of the drug. Not change, not change it into a frightening, scary end of life drug.  
Speaker 2    02:18:12    All right. Let me hand you, let's mark this as plaintiff's exhibit 13.  
Speaker 0    02:18:19    Thank you.  
Speaker 2    02:18:22    This is an interoffice memo dated 1994.  
Speaker 0    02:18:33    You gave me two copies  
Speaker 2    02:18:50    And this is from Michael Friedman. Uh, what was his role in 1994?  
Speaker 6    02:18:56    He was head of marketing in sales  
Speaker 2    02:18:58    And it's two,  
Speaker 6    02:19:00    Two, the three people he reported  
Speaker 2    02:19:02    To. And that's Mor Sackler Raymond Sackler and Dr. Richard Sackler, which would  
Speaker 6    02:19:06    Be that's. Yep.  
Speaker 2    02:19:08    And under discussion, if you go to page four, it says, we believe that the FDA will restrict our initial launch of OxyContin to the cancer pain market. Did you believe that at the time  
Speaker 6    02:19:37    He may have believed it? I didn't believe it. Okay.  
Speaker 2    02:19:39    However, we also believe that physicians will perceive OxyContin.  
Speaker 6    02:19:44    Were you reading from which  
Speaker 2    02:19:44    Number next sentence, 1.3  
Speaker 6    02:19:47    1.3. Thank you.  
Speaker 2    02:19:48    However, we also believe that physicians will perceive OxyContin as controlled release Percocet without acetaminophen and expand its use. Now is OxyContin controlled release Percocet  
Speaker 6    02:20:02    Without acetaminophen. That would be one way of describing it because there are only two active ingredients. Um, acetaminophen and oxycodone,  
Speaker 2    02:20:16    Uh, is, is OxyContin controlled release, more powerful than Percocet?  
Speaker 6    02:20:22    Depends on the dose. The initial dose at 10 milligrams twice a day would be equivalent to the standard introductory dose of Percocet, four tablets, one tablet, four times a day. In other words, four. So it would be the same dose.  
Speaker 2    02:20:40    When you all did studies, did you find out that 10 milligrams of OxyContin had the same effect as a placebo? And it was really only the 20 milligram that was effective.  
Speaker 6    02:20:56    I don't recall that, but it's possible.  
Speaker 2    02:21:03    Um, we do not want to position OxyContin in a way that will discourage physicians from using OxyContin for the chronic non-malignant pain. Okay.  
Speaker 6    02:21:13    Especially where are you reading from again?  
Speaker 2    02:21:15    Next paragraph. Okay. We will. I mean, next sentence, especially when we have studies available that demonstrate efficacy and safety for this indication. Okay. Do you know what your study showed about non-malignant chronic pain patients developing, uh, uh, tolerance or dependency or withdrawal from OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    02:21:47    I, I don't have them immediately in my mind.  
Speaker 2    02:21:53    Let's uh, mark been marked correct  
Speaker 6    02:22:03    Time for another break or  
Speaker 0    02:22:07    Two and half? Yeah, just off the record. What do you guys thinking timewise for lunch? I'm still, oh, I'm sorry. Let's go off the record. That was go. We  
Speaker 1    02:22:19    Are off the record at 11:45 AM. We are back on the record at  
Speaker 0    02:22:25    11:57 AM.  
Speaker 2    02:22:39    Um, I'm gonna hand you a document. It is, uh, dated April 23rd, 1997. And on the bottom of page, one is an email you sent, uh, regarding San Antonio and it says, uh, it's 4 20, 2 97. This is P D D 1 7 1 8 1 1 4 1. And it's to looks like Michael Friedman. Michael, I am somewhat surprised that 18 months into marketing, significant groups of experts, oncologists, for example, believe that OxyContin has a ceiling effect. What did you mean by ceiling effect  
Speaker 6    02:23:37    Has a dose above which it would not be effective. That was what I meant not be effective.  
Speaker 2    02:23:49    Okay. What materials could we pull together that would smash this critical misconception? Can we put together some approaches and test whether they would be potent weapons in this effort? And he writes back and says to you, there will always be misconceptions about drug substances for controlled release drugs. Many of these misconceptions are the result of residual attitudes associated with the immediate release forms. Um,  
Speaker 2    02:24:29    Uh, I'll just read the whole thing. So for example, morphine has a personality quote that was shaped when it was an IV drug. Oxycodone has a personality quote that was influenced by many years of oxycodone use and Percocet. We built a large part of our platform on this personality and it is to differentiate OxyContin from Duragesic. This differentiation has led to much non-malignant business marketing. This next paragraph marketing is not only about what you are it's about what you are not. We have had success beyond our expectations. That is in part due to the unique personality of OxyContin. Even as we seek to increase the use of the drug in higher doses, we should be very careful as you know, the strength of the judge drug is principally a barrier in malignant pain. If we do not want to change the image in a way, or I'm sorry, we do not want to change the image in a way that will discourage non-malignant use a barrage would be ill advised and you wrote back. Excellent points. What about rifle shots? Is that correct?  
Speaker 6    02:25:40    That's correct. That's what I wrote.  
Speaker 2    02:25:45    And over here on the, before that there's a letter to you from James Lang and he's pointing out that he sat in some oncology focus groups and he, um,  
Speaker 6    02:26:01    What page is that?  
Speaker 2    02:26:02    It's page two,  
Speaker 6    02:26:04    The sec, second page of what you handed me. Oh, Jim. Yes. Okay.  
Speaker 2    02:26:13    It says, um,  
Speaker 0    02:26:17    <affirmative>  
Speaker 2    02:26:20    Issues affecting the oncologist utilization of OxyContin are MDs. Feel the product dosing has a ceiling. Don't feel it is as strong as Ms. Cotton like, and are very comfortable with MS. Contin and don't see a need for another product, except where MS. Contin fails or Ms. Cotton fails. Interestingly, when asked to describe what they like about OxyContin, they are for the most part cited, all the key points our reps are or should be stating in their sales presentation. Um, the anesthesiology focus group was of less Saturday evening was of less value. However, their primary concerns were that Medtronic pump being used by the orthopods and the need for Purdue to educate surgeons on proper post-surgery pain management in fears with opioid prescribing. Um, is that the email that prompted you to write the letter?  
Speaker 6    02:27:13    It might be, I don't recall.  
Speaker 2    02:27:15    I'm sorry. I want you to write your email.  
Speaker 6    02:27:20    It could be  
Speaker 2    02:27:21    Why don't we mark that as exhibit 14,  
Speaker 6    02:27:47    But I'm not sure it could have been, there could be another email in which I pointed out the lack of sales development with oncologists as compared to our plan. So I'm not sure that this is, but it would've been around the same time. Perhaps, maybe I looked at the results with oncologists after I read this  
Speaker 2    02:28:32    I about this. Okay. So this is the 1993.  
Speaker 8    02:28:37    That's already in evidence exhibit two or three. It's the May, 1993 memorandum.  
Speaker 0    02:28:59    We go,  
Speaker 2    02:29:00    All right.  
Speaker 6    02:29:01    Are we finished with  
Speaker 2    02:29:02    This? Yes, sir.  
Speaker 0    02:29:03    Okay.  
Speaker 6    02:29:05    Put it on the pile.  
Speaker 2    02:29:08    I want to go back to the May, 1993 memorandum. And this is the  
Speaker 6    02:29:17    July 92. What exhibit number are we? Uh,  
Speaker 2    02:29:21    Wait a minute. Let me, can I see what you have?  
Speaker 6    02:29:23    Sure.  
Speaker 2    02:29:24    Lemme just clear this up. Yeah, it's not in yet. That's it? April 2nd, 1993. Yeah. All right. Let's um, I'm sorry, I'm gonna stop. Let's let's um, jump to the April 2nd, 1993 memorandum. Let's mark this as Sackler 15. What is P FRC at the top of this  
Speaker 6    02:30:11    Purdue Frederick research center.  
Speaker 2    02:30:14    And it's the R and D meeting  
Speaker 6    02:30:17    R and D meeting.  
Speaker 2    02:30:19    And it is dated April 2nd, 1993. Correct.  
Speaker 6    02:30:24    That's what it says.  
Speaker 2    02:30:30    And part I wanted to ask you about, if you go back to page 10 and <affirmative> and you were in attendance at this meeting, correct?  
Speaker 6    02:30:53    Uh, I don't let me check that. I certainly don't recollect by date  
Speaker 2    02:31:00    Sackler  
Speaker 6    02:31:01    Attendance. Yes, that was me.  
Speaker 2    02:31:02    All right. Yes. So on page 10, it looks like you're discussing an osteoarthritis study. That was being  
Speaker 6    02:31:11    Okay. Where on page  
Speaker 2    02:31:12    10? I am on the third paragraph.  
Speaker 6    02:31:15    Okay. I'm sorry.  
Speaker 2    02:31:16    Fourth paragraph.  
Speaker 6    02:31:17    This says page 10, but it doesn't look like what you have here. Okay.  
Speaker 2    02:31:25    Yes it  
Speaker 6    02:31:26    Is he?  
Speaker 2    02:31:26    Yeah.  
Speaker 6    02:31:28    Okay. Pardon. So  
Speaker 2    02:31:29    Read along with me, uh, the section over here. Rrr, do you know who RR is?  
Speaker 6    02:31:34    Robert re  
Speaker 2    02:31:35    Okay. What was his job at that time?  
Speaker 6    02:31:37    He was a senior medical researcher  
Speaker 2    02:31:42    And he says here in this paragraph, the protocol for the placebo controlled study versus two dose levels in patients with osteoarthritis, what's discussed with C right now, would that be Curtis Wright?  
Speaker 6    02:31:55    That's that's what I would  
Speaker 2    02:31:56    Understand it. And at that time he was the person who was reviewing Al's OxyContin submission to the FDA.  
Speaker 6    02:32:04    He was the medical reviewer. That's  
Speaker 2    02:32:06    Correct. And he's the guy that actually approved it to be sold or, you know, allow you all to sell it from the FDA. That's  
Speaker 6    02:32:12    My recollection.  
Speaker 2    02:32:13    Okay. You all ultimately hired him a few years later, didn't you?  
Speaker 6    02:32:17    Um, we did hire him, but not after his tenure at the FDA. Um, we, he spoke to somebody at Purdue when he was planning on leaving the FDA and, uh, Paul and I discussed it and agreed that we should not hire somebody who had ju who had reviewed our product and who left. And so he went to another company, um, regrettably for us because he was very, very knowledgeable. Sure.  
Speaker 2    02:32:56    He went there very smart. He went there for a short period of time and then came to work for you.  
Speaker 6    02:33:00    I don't remember. It was certainly, it was certainly I, my recollection is a couple of years, two or three years, but I don't recall exactly the record I'm certain could be produced.  
Speaker 2    02:33:14    All right. Well, let's, let's take a look at page 10. The protocol for the placebo controlled study versus two dose levels in patients with a osteoarthritis was discussed with C wite. He stated there were very strong opinions of members at the FDA that opiates should not be used for nonmalignant pain. And this study,  
Speaker 6    02:33:35    We gently just follow you if I may. I'm a slow reader. I'm sorry, but I just do wanna follow you. Great.  
Speaker 2    02:33:42    Well, I'll read it again. Okay. He stated there were very strong opinions of members at the FDA that opiates should not be used for nonmalignant pain. And this study would not be greatly accepted by the FDA as it is written. Now, for that reason, C Wright has suggested rewriting the protocol in order to make it clear. Osteoarthritis is being used as a convenient pain model. He would also like to the open label extension to be eliminated from the protocol. Now, what do you refer to as the open label extension  
Speaker 6    02:34:18    In many trials of chronic used drugs after the trial period, which might have been 12 weeks was completed. The subjects in the trial were given an option to continue being treated and monitored by their physician. It's completely at their election or choice. They, they some decide that they want to some decide that they don't and, um, we continue them on medication for an extended period of time. This is extremely common in, in all kinds of trials.  
Speaker 2    02:35:01    P Goldenheim stated the open label extension could be done as a post-marketing study, B Keiko and R reader will meet with P Laur to communicate what is necessary to revise the protocol. The protocol must be clear that we are not going for a general indication for the treatment of osteoarthritis with osteo, with oxycodone. And then down below that, it says Dr. Richard Sackler asked if there was consensus within the pain group about the appropriate use of opiates for certain patient groups, B Keiko stated this is very, a very controversial area. And most people in the pain group say that well, controlled studies are necessary to investigate the questions Dr. Sackler next paragraph says, Dr. Sackler has suggested a smaller group meet in house to clarify the political issues. What were the political issues,  
Speaker 6    02:36:04    The political issues would've referred to the preferences and the, um, sometimes prejudices of physicians and other experts  
Speaker 2    02:36:26    Over whether you should prescribed opioids for nonmalignant pain,  
Speaker 6    02:36:31    Uh, and for, and for what conditions in nonmalignant pain. I don't think there were very many people or any people really of any reputation who would've prescribed that has prohibited the use of opioids for nonmalignant pain. But there were a lot of opinions when it came to listing one condition or another or another, or another pain is the most common symptom that patients have in and present to doctors. And so every doctor has his own opinion as to what is appro, what is best and what is appropriate for treating pain, um, or in some cases, um, what pains are not appropriate to be treated at all. And this is highly, um, it's highly personal and contentious issue in the medical world and has been so for a hundred years.  
Speaker 2    02:37:42    And that's the reason that morphine was stigmatized and not prescribed, um, generally for nonmalignant pain. Uh, it was more reserved by physicians for end of life, hospice care and cancer pain, um, in the medical community.  
Speaker 6    02:38:01    I don't understand the connection you're drawing. Um, I think the situation with morphine is unique. Um, and, uh, it doesn't relate to what we're talking about here.  
Speaker 2    02:38:25    What about heroin? Was it prescribed for, uh, uh,  
Speaker 6    02:38:30    For pain pain? Um, it is prescribed for pain in many countries and is part of the pharmaco, uh, the Pharmacopia for example, it is very popular in the UK.  
Speaker 2    02:38:43    Is it controlled?  
Speaker 6    02:38:45    It is just like morphine  
Speaker 2    02:38:46    For, into life pain. Mostly.  
Speaker 6    02:38:48    I can't tell you that because I don't know, but it is it's, I don't believe that it established itself as an analgesic in the United States at any time, even when it was, was an analgesic and anal and was available.  
Speaker 2    02:39:10    I'm gonna hand you a memo.  
Speaker 6    02:39:12    Are we finished with this?  
Speaker 2    02:39:14    Uh, yes. We are hand you a memo dated, um, project team meeting minutes of Tuesday, August 17th, 1993. It, it says here under marketing, there's some initial interest in having a five milligram and 10 milligram immediate release oxycodone camp capsule produced. Um, do you know why marketing wanted those produced?  
Speaker 6    02:40:08    I, I could, I could guess, but I don't know specifically why they wanted it.  
Speaker 2    02:40:15    Well, if you don't mind, turn back to page four and on page four, what I really want to ask you about is potential studies.  
Speaker 6    02:40:32    Okay. And  
Speaker 2    02:40:35    Mike Innerato is the guy we mentioned earlier who was  
Speaker 6    02:40:39    In the Innerato  
Speaker 2    02:40:41    Yes. In, in the marketing department, correct? Yes.  
Speaker 6    02:40:43    Yes.  
Speaker 2    02:40:44    And he's the guy in charge of perhaps, uh, the sales force that goes out and tries to sell?  
Speaker 6    02:40:51    No, he would be in charge of the marketing execution, um, of the strategy. So he would be intimately involved with the promotional materials, um, secondarily involved with training, um, and would be the person who would, um, set the direction and themes that would be used, but he wouldn't be a person who would, uh, be responsible for sales, although he might go out in the field and he should to determine what is happening.  
Speaker 2    02:41:33    Let me rephrase it then. Sure. As part of marketing, he's the guy who is supposed to get the word out and, uh, hopefully increase sales by advertising the product and convincing people to write prescriptions.  
Speaker 6    02:41:50    Uh, not directly the sales people were the principle agents of getting the word out to use your expression of, of, of putting the materials in the hands of doctors, etc. I don't recollect that advertising ever played much of a role in the promotion of OxyContin.  
Speaker 2    02:42:13    Let's talk about, um, if you look at 4.3 potential studies, Mike, I'm gonna read that paragraph. Mike Innerato said that an OxyContin versus Percocet comparative study.  
Speaker 6    02:42:30    Okay. Pot. Oh, you weren't reading. Okay. From  
Speaker 2    02:42:32    Potential  
Speaker 6    02:42:33    Studies.  
Speaker 2    02:42:33    Okay.  
Speaker 6    02:42:34    Mike, I'm sorry. This is so small. It's not so easy,  
Speaker 2    02:42:36    But Mike Innerato and unfortunately that's the way Purdue gave it to us. So, uh, we're stuck with it too. Potential studies. Mike Innerato said that an OxyContin versus Percocet comparative study would be useful for marketing purposes. Now in trying to decide whether the drug is safe, uh, is it normal to have the marketing people decide what studies will be done?  
Speaker 6    02:43:09    They might be involved in commenting on it or suggesting things, but normally, um, it's the medical department that has the primary responsibility, uh, both for the medical research strategy and the, and certainly the implementation  
Speaker 2    02:43:28    Through such a stay. I'm gonna read the next sentence through such a study OC 88, 11 0 5 has previously been conducted and published an abstract form. It was a single dose study using non GMP released material. Mike Innerato stated that a multiple dose study would be best to support claims relating to relief of post-surgical pain, low back pain and Heredic neurology pain. Um, from my review of that, it looks like he's got claims he wants to make and is trying to design studies to support him. Is that what that appears to you?  
Speaker 6    02:44:08    No, um, he half yes. Half, no. What I think he is doing here in the general is he is in a group meeting, presenting ideas for consideration by the group. Uh, certainly this was not directive and he was not in a position to direct any studies be done or not done.  
Speaker 2    02:44:34    And then the next sentence says, Mike Innerato stated marketing would like to position differently than Ms. Cotton Robert reader and who was Robert re  
Speaker 6    02:44:44    He was the senior medical officer. Mm-hmm in this, in this, um, minute of the meeting. Mm-hmm um, let me just read, catch up to you. I said, well, they just invest to support claims.  
Speaker 2    02:44:57    Robert reer stated that the FDA has suggested that we do not issue claims supporting the general use of a schedule, two opioid in patients with nonmalignant pain. Robert reader indicated that decisions to make additional claims could be developed after the product is marketed. Jim Conover agreed with Robert Reed, but added that any study conducted in patient with nonmalignant pain could be included in the clinical study section of the package, insert Robert reader added that any proposed marketing claims and their supported studies should be first reviewed with our legal and regulatory departments. Perhaps the marketing concepts could be reviewed. Now, Robert reader stated that the marketing could start thinking of a five year plan on potential marketing studies and strategies. Did I read that correctly?  
Speaker 6    02:45:48    You did.  
Speaker 2    02:46:23    Um, and then do you have another, this one here? Um, I'm gonna hand you  
Speaker 6    02:46:53    Let's mark this through  
Speaker 2    02:46:55    This. Yes, sir. Um, exhibit 17. Yeah. If I haven't done it, I'm, I'm gonna move to admit all these into evidence as exhibits one through 16 and 17. Um, and this is a appears to be a speech you gave. Is that what this is or a publication you made?  
Speaker 6    02:47:40    This looks like it was a news paper or magazine, like, um, internal document for, um, the field force principally. I think it was basically the field force and, and, and in in-house marketing and salespeople who would like to see their picture there or be quoted or  
Speaker 2    02:48:04    Whatever. And it's the winner of 1996. Is that right?  
Speaker 6    02:48:08    That's correct.  
Speaker 2    02:48:20    And, um, if you'll turn to page eight for me please. I'm sorry. I misspoke. I turned to page two, please.  
Speaker 6    02:48:36    Oh, no problem.  
Speaker 2    02:48:45    Uh, over on the third column, yes. Uh, halfway down it says the development and launching of OxyContin tablets. Yes. Is the first time that we have chosen to obsolete our own product and we have done it before the competition has slowed our growth or of sales. And you were referring to Ms. Cotton that you obsoleted, is that correct?  
Speaker 6    02:49:07    That's correct.  
Speaker 2    02:49:11    And then at the bottom it says we have the most powerful selling package insert in the category and in the industry. And is that accurate?  
Speaker 6    02:49:23    I'm trying to see where it is we have is which paragraph in that color, the very  
Speaker 2    02:49:29    Last paragraph  
Speaker 6    02:49:31    We have the most powerful sewing package, right? Yes. That  
Speaker 2    02:49:37    Is for, and if you'll turn to page eight, it says, uh, speech at the top continued from page two. So I'm assuming this is a speech you gave.  
Speaker 6    02:50:02    I may be, but I don't know. We'll see  
Speaker 2    02:50:06    OxyContin was brought to NDA. Um, what's NDA  
Speaker 6    02:50:12    To NDA filing. That's the filing of the new drug application, right?  
Speaker 2    02:50:17    Uh, from early phase one work on time and in an incredibly compressed period of two years time, that's because an NDA usually takes longer. Correct.  
Speaker 6    02:50:28    Well, um,  
Speaker 2    02:50:33    And lemme just preface it with the reason it takes longer is because there's a number of studies that have to be done, both animal and human to determine if a drug is safe and efficacious. Correct.  
Speaker 6    02:50:46    Right. Um, in general, that's correct.  
Speaker 2    02:50:50    But in this case, you all got it done in an incredibly compressed period of time of two years. Robert reader set the goal in November of 93 to file by December 31st 95. And we submitted on December 28th, 95, 3 days ahead of schedule this didn't quote just happen. It was a deathly coordinated planned event that took dozens of worker years of effort to succeed true,  
Speaker 2    02:51:16    The most demanding NDA package for any analgesic product ever submitted didn't languish at the agency. Unlike the years that other filings linger at FDA, this product was approved in 11 months, 14 days. Our previous best approval time for other products was measured in years. Not months much can be attributed to the unparalleled teamwork of the product team and the FDA's approval team, which came into being as responsive, our joint desires to operate within the content of a new timeframe. Both we and the pilot, Doug division of FDA were motivated by the same goal to set the highest standard NDA with the broadest app indications approved in the shortest possible timeframe. Did I read that correctly?  
Speaker 6    02:52:01    You did.  
Speaker 0    02:52:02    Okay.  
Speaker 6    02:52:06    Did you have any questions about  
Speaker 2    02:52:08    That? Nope. I just wanted to know if that was the statement you got and is it accurate?  
Speaker 6    02:52:13    This was a, I believe it is accurate. I'm certain that the facts in there were accurate. The tone was very upbeat. Uh, almost a team enthusiasm building expression. I believe the facts are correct. Um, and I perhaps, uh, I don't regret trying to energize our sales force. I think that was my mission, but, um, this isn't what I would have written if a board had been, uh, or said if the board had been there, I wouldn't have been, uh, the tone. Would've been more restrained. I'm not embarrassed by the tone in the context. I think it was very reasonable.  
Speaker 2    02:53:15    We're still bombs to the wall. One,  
Speaker 6    02:53:17    You have any questions about the reason it was so quick or anything else?  
Speaker 2    02:53:25    No, we got a lot of documents to get through. So I'm trying to hit the high  
Speaker 6    02:53:27    Points  
Speaker 2    02:53:28    And ask you about the,  
Speaker 6    02:53:29    Okay.  
Speaker 0    02:53:30    Um,  
Speaker 2    02:53:37    One of the things that they wrote you, um, um, do you have the other pages of this when you got your approval? If you'll look at the last page on overall conclusion, and this is a document, uh, from the medical officer review, uh, Curtis Wright,  
Speaker 6    02:54:39    This is part of the approval part of the FDA approval  
Speaker 2    02:54:43    Process. And he he's the guy that now works for Purdue Pharma, correct?  
Speaker 6    02:54:47    No, no. He hasn't worked for Purdue Pharma for a long time.  
Speaker 2    02:54:50    Okay. He was  
Speaker 6    02:54:51    Regrettably,  
Speaker 2    02:54:52    But hired by Purdue Pharma subsequently. Correct.  
Speaker 6    02:54:55    He was hired by Purdue Pharma  
Speaker 2    02:55:00    And his last,  
Speaker 6    02:55:01    Maybe three years after this. I, I don't recall exactly.  
Speaker 2    02:55:05    And why don't we go ahead and mark this as exhibit 18. Um, his overall conclusion on the last page is CR oxycodone that's controlled release, correct?  
Speaker 6    02:55:31    Yes.  
Speaker 2    02:55:32    Appears to be a B I D alternative to conventional Q I D oxycodone and, um, approval is recommended care should be taken to limit competitive promotion. What is competitive promotion?  
Speaker 6    02:55:50    I'm not sure what he meant. I could guess that he means promotion comparing this to other agents that are used in various pain conditions, but that's a guess  
Speaker 2    02:56:05    On part. And then I think the next sentence explains it. He says the product has been shown to be as good as current therapy, but has not been shown to have a significant advantage beyond reduction in frequency of dosing. Other than you don't have to take it as much. The FDA, uh, has concluded that, that there's no benefit other than, uh, uh, has not been shown to have a significant advantage beyond reduction in frequency of dosing  
Speaker 6    02:56:34    Not been shown, uh, in the NDA. Yes.  
Speaker 2    02:56:38    All right. Let's um,  
Speaker 6    02:56:45    Probably announcing lunch,  
Speaker 2    02:56:47    Probably. So just go off the record.  
Speaker 1    02:56:49    We are off the record at 12:32 PM. We are back on record at 12:32 PM.  
Speaker 2    02:56:58    You have this one mark 22nd. Ready to put that in.  
Speaker 6    02:57:13    Where's my briefcase in case I need another, if I need, if I need another pair of glasses.  
Speaker 2    02:57:21    Yeah. March  
Speaker 6    02:57:32    Something stronger. <laugh> I may have stronger ones. Yeah. Some of these documents are so difficult to read.  
Speaker 2    02:57:40    Yeah. They're difficult. This is the OxyContin project team memo. Do you know if you ever reviewed this memo?  
Speaker 6    02:58:04    I wasn't on the project team. I don't know if I reviewed it. Was it I'm curious. Just I could read through this. Was it sent to me or not?  
Speaker 2    02:58:14    Uh, I don't know if it was or not  
Speaker 6    02:58:16    Looks like it was not, I was not on the circulation list.  
Speaker 2    02:58:22    Well, the, this list down here is yeah, there is a circulation list. Um, it appears that it was not. Um, and if you would go over to page four, the last paragraph down to the bottom 6.2, Mike Innerato asked if marketing would be able to review the package insert, do you have any idea why marketing wanted to review the package? Insert?  
Speaker 6    02:59:09    Surely there many reasons  
Speaker 2    02:59:14    Robert Reeder stated the package insert will be circulated to marketing and other reviewers at the same time as the protocol review. Um,  
Speaker 6    02:59:24    As I said earlier, the package insert was becoming originally 20 years prior to this package, inserts were very, very brief and very simple over time. The agency  
Speaker 6    02:59:43    Wanted them, uh, to be more complete documents. And then, uh, it had regulatory implications as well. So if you look of the history of use of package inserts, they, by this time had become fairly long and extensive documentation for the physician. Their notion of being printed in that tiny format, um, and stuck with every package in a sense was inconsistent. So you ended up sometimes having this package insert that was as big as the bottle adhered to every bottle, but it was available, uh, to physicians in a variety of other forms. Um, the physician's desk reference, I think you must be familiar with, which was the way most physicians then would read a package insert. It was just a compilation of all the approved products package inserts.  
Speaker 2    03:00:48    What is marketing gonna add to that?  
Speaker 6    03:00:50    First of all, they have to understand what the package insert is gonna say about the product so that they can think of, um, how they're going to present promotional materials. Secondarily, they might, if the package insert is in draft form and under discussion with the agency, turn to the responsible medical officer, as an example, or the regulatory people and say, you know, this could be misunderstood. This uh, could represent a problem. Um, and so they would contribute to the clarity, but the medical department was and regulatory department with the principal owners of the document in the company and the owner of the document for the government was the food and drug administration. And of course they had determinative power as to what it, what it ultimately ended up as  
Speaker 2    03:01:50    Sure. You'll turn to page five under 7.0 marketing.  
Speaker 6    03:01:59    Yes.  
Speaker 2    03:02:02    It says postmarketing studies QL. Pharmacoeconomic per Percocet. Duragesic Robert reader discussed some of the planned postmarketing studies. These included an OxyContin versus MS. Contin comparative study, the Duragesic comparative study, which is currently on hold and a relative potency study, comparing OxyContin to MS. Contin Robert reader stated that we would need additional studies to recruit several hundred patients in order to get data to support claims for non-cancer pain. Uh, this was on March of 1994. Do you know if that, uh, if those studies were done,  
Speaker 6    03:02:43    I'm sure they were done after approval, but I don't know whether any were done before approval.  
Speaker 2    03:02:52    Okay. Do you know if they were done before the drug was put on the mark?  
Speaker 6    03:02:58    I don't know.  
Speaker 2    03:02:59    Okay. Who is Robert Reeder?  
Speaker 6    03:03:01    He was the senior medical officer on this project at Purdue Frederick.  
Speaker 0    03:03:08    Okay.  
Speaker 2    03:03:10    And then it says, Mike Innerato again, he's the marketing guy, correct? Right.  
Speaker 2    03:03:15    Stated that a Percocet comparative study would be a benefit to marketing. Mike Innerato replied to Bob KACO's question on claims by answering that equal efficacy of OxyContin to Percocet with better quality of life would be a beneficial claim. Mike Innerato stated in the future, Tramadol would pose a threat to the OxyContin market. Um, and then down below that it says 7.2 marketing claims studies desired. Mike Innerato gave a presentation on the results from the focus groups, a copy of the market research results would be issued to the OxyContin team. The results of the focus groups are attached. The results, cover issues, such as benefits, positioning, and claims. Do you know whether the studies recommended by Robert reader were done before it went to market, or the studies requested by the marketing guy were done before it went to market?  
Speaker 6    03:04:10    I don't know.  
Speaker 2    03:04:56    Then there is a, if you go to page the very last page, I guess it is OxyContin presentation, 3 20, 2 94, up at the top,  
Speaker 6    03:05:12    Just a second OxyContin presentation. I see it.  
Speaker 2    03:05:18    And it says down at the bottom, uh, it's got all the list of, um, OxyContin will be positioned as the only opioid combining the efficacy and safety of oxycodone with the convenience of a 12 hour schedule, which allows for precise and accurate conversion and titration while allowing the patient could lead a more normal quality of life. OxyContin is the opiate to start with, for patients who may be on Percocet, lower Tabin and the opiate to stay with as the disease progresses. Now that was a marketing campaign, correct? To start with, stay with,  
Speaker 6    03:06:08    Yes.  
Speaker 2    03:06:09    And, and start with, stay with campaign. Do you know who came up with the start with, stay with marketing campaign?  
Speaker 6    03:06:14    I wish I could lay claim to it, but no, I don't know who, who came up with it.  
Speaker 2    03:06:20    And then, um, it says, um,  
Speaker 6    03:06:27    That was not the launch campaign in a sense. It may have been a subtext of the launch campaign, which was the old way and the new way, but  
Speaker 2    03:06:45    It says, uh, at very, at the bottom, less potential abuse than other opioids. Do you know where that, um, claim came from?  
Speaker 6    03:06:56    I don't know. I'm looking at, is this after the package insert? Nope. No, it was before the package insert was approved. I don't know.  
Speaker 2    03:07:11    Do you know whether OxyContin had less potential abuse than other opioids?  
Speaker 6    03:07:21    I don't know what this refers to.  
Speaker 2    03:07:27    Do you have this one? Do we mark that one?  
Speaker 6    03:07:54    We did not.  
Speaker 2    03:07:55    Yeah. Let's mark that as 19  
Speaker 0    03:07:59    Moved  
Speaker 2    03:08:00    Into evidence. And here is this one. This is PD D 9 9 5 2 0 8 2 1 3 0 6. This appears to be the,  
Speaker 6    03:08:13    Do you wanna mark it?  
Speaker 2    03:08:14    Yes, let's do that  
Speaker 6    03:08:20    Now. It's 20. Are you keeping these? Yes. Okay. It's number 20  
Speaker 2    03:08:25    OxyContin tablets project team.  
Speaker 6    03:08:32    Okay.  
Speaker 2    03:08:34    And this is June 22nd, 1994, correct.  
Speaker 6    03:08:40    That's what it says.  
Speaker 2    03:08:41    And on page two marketing, it says,  
Speaker 6    03:08:45    Wait, wait, I see June 8th, not June 22nd.  
Speaker 2    03:08:51    Oh, the date it's sent is June 22nd. Over on the right. Whoops.  
Speaker 6    03:08:55    Okay. My, my mistake. Okay.  
Speaker 2    03:08:57    So it's project team meetings from June 8th. You're you're correct. Uh, on page two, under 1.0, marketing under the OxyContin tablets project team meeting minutes, Mike Innerato gave an overview of the oxycodone market referring to sales and growth charts and prescription data. Mr. Innerato also presented our current strategy for introducing OxyContin tablets to the market. OxyContin tablets will be targeted at the cancer pain market, uh, was a decision subsequently made not to target, uh, specifically at the cancer pain Mar market.  
Speaker 6    03:09:47    I would infer that, but I don't know when,  
Speaker 2    03:09:52    But at least by June 8th of 94, the plan was still to target the cancer pain market.  
Speaker 6    03:10:00    Yes. Uh, it doesn't say that the however that we, let me just read this again, uh, will be targeted at the cancer pain market. It doesn't say that it will not be promoted to the non-malignant pain market.  
Speaker 2    03:10:24    Okay. It says OxyContin, uh, OxyContin way targeted at the cancer pain market, since it is possible that morphine generic products may soon be in competition with Ms. Cotton tablets. We will target patients who are currently receiving Ms. Cotton as well as those patients thought to eventually use Ms. Cotton tablets, I E on the analgesic ladder late step one, step two. And step three, the bulk of opioid business comes from 7,500 physicians, 3000 of whom are oncologists. Um,  
Speaker 6    03:11:01    That's correct.  
Speaker 2    03:11:03    So you all had market share from Ms. Cotton, correct? Yes. And in order to keep from losing that market share to generics who are gonna be priced much lower than Ms. Cotton, uh, generally, correct.  
Speaker 6    03:11:18    That was the trend at that time. Yes.  
Speaker 2    03:11:21    Um, what you did is put out OxyContin an obsoleted MS. Contin, and if you could keep the MS Contin market through the use of OxyContin, you wouldn't lose any market share there. And if you could expand it to non-malignant pain, you would gain all of that market share. Correct?  
Speaker 3    03:11:42    Well, I, I object to the form of the question at the minimum is compound.  
Speaker 2    03:11:46    Sure. Go ahead. You can answer.  
Speaker 6    03:11:49    So could you just break it into two questions and I'll answer them both.  
Speaker 2    03:11:53    Um, can you read the question back, uh,  
Speaker 6    03:11:56    And stop after one <laugh>  
Speaker 12    03:11:59    What you did was put OxyContin and obsolete cotton an Ms. Cotton. And if you could keep the Ms. Cotton market through the use of OxyContin, you wouldn't lose any market. Sure. There,  
Speaker 6    03:12:10    Okay. And that's what this seems to say. And certainly that was an element of consideration. And part of the strategy, what I think might be missing here is any discussion of the non-malignant pain market, which you asked me a question. Could you read question two?  
Speaker 12    03:12:37    And if you could expand it to the non-malignant pain, you would gain all of that market share. Correct?  
Speaker 6    03:12:43    We would not, we would not gain all of the non-malignant pain market share, but we could augment or add to the cancer pain market, nonmalignant pain. And I'm, I'm quite surprised actually, that this didn't discuss nonmalignant pain as late as June 8th. Um, so for whatever reason, the, either Mr Innerato or the person who was writing the minutes didn't seem to include that. Cuz I don't think not to my recollection. Was there ever consideration of restricting this product to malignant pain alone? It was widely used Percodan, Percocet were widely used in non-malignant pain. Sure.  
Speaker 2    03:13:35    Down below that it says marketing has been interviewing potential advertising groups and is close to selecting one. Do you know which advertising group was ultimately selected?  
Speaker 6    03:13:44    I don't know, but I'm sure you, we could find out if that were important.  
Speaker 2    03:13:48    Right. And then under publications right below that manuscripts for studies C 90 dash oh 7 0 8 and OC 93 0 1 0 1 have been sent to Dr. Stanski and mana for review as potential authors. Why was, um, Purdue sending out manuscripts to doctors to be potential authors?  
Speaker 6    03:14:18    I can't say for sure, but two possibilities arise in my mind. One possibility is that the manuscript had come to us in draft form and we had helped them fill in details such as the references and so forth. That was one of the ways that companies help authors, um, lighten the burden. So to speak of writing a paper. Uh, the second possibility is the first draft might have been written in house and sent to them for their review and their correction and additions.  
Speaker 2    03:14:58    Well, it says as potential authors, meaning it would, it would appear that they authored the manuscript, even though it really came from Purdue, correct?  
Speaker 6    03:15:06    Objection, it's a collaborative effort. It's we can't, we don't, uh, impose on any author, uh, what they submit, what they submit for publication is submitted from them by them and totally, uh, in their control. Um,  
Speaker 2    03:15:31    Do you know if Dr Stanski and man DMA were paid by Purdue?  
Speaker 6    03:15:35    I don't know.  
Speaker 2    03:15:36    Um, do you know whether these manuscripts, um, ultimately identified, um, Purdue Pharma as being any part of the, uh, author?  
Speaker 6    03:15:49    I don't know, but it was not infrequent that employees of Purdue Pharma would be co-authors on manuscripts. I don't know whether in this case they were.  
Speaker 2    03:16:00    And then if you'll turn over to page four of this document, it says clinical status of core clinical program. Robert Reeder. Now he's the  
Speaker 6    03:16:23    Medical senior, senior medical officer on, on this product.  
Speaker 2    03:16:28    Okay. Robert re stated that this OC 92, 1, 1 0 2 study, a pain has been completed and preliminary data is currently being reviewed. It appears that the 10 milligram tablet is similar to placebo in efficacy, but the 20 milligram tablet was significantly different compared to placebo. Um, were you aware that the 10 milligram tablet was similar to placebo and efficacy?  
Speaker 6    03:16:59    I don't recall. That would not be unusual in any analgesic trial. However  
Speaker 2    03:17:44    You have this one <inaudible> then I'm gonna ask you about the meetings of the international R and D meeting. This is, did we mark that? We did. This is, uh, PDD. I'm sorry. That's fine. We can go ahead and mark it if you want PDD 1 7 0 1 8 2 4 7 2 3 exhibit 21, which appears to now we're into November of 94 and present was Dr. RS Sackler, correct?  
Speaker 6    03:18:29    If that's what it says, I must have been present for at least part of it.  
Speaker 2    03:18:34    Then on page 13.  
Speaker 6    03:18:38    Oh yes. I was probably present for all of  
Speaker 2    03:18:40    It. Page 13, third paragraph.  
Speaker 0    03:18:55    Okay.  
Speaker 2    03:18:58    Dr. Yang asked if there were any  
Speaker 6    03:19:01    Second. I'm sorry. Third page 13. This one you're reading from the top here.  
Speaker 2    03:19:07    Yes. Reading from the middle of the paragraph.  
Speaker 6    03:19:08    Okay. Thank you.  
Speaker 2    03:19:09    About the eighth line down Dr. Yang asked if there were any statistically significant results. It was confirmed that the 20 milligram product was significantly better than the placebo, but the 10 milligram product was not. And, um, was that brought up at the meeting?  
Speaker 6    03:19:30    It must have been, this is minutes of the meeting, so I'm sure this was, these minutes were generally of good quality.  
Speaker 2    03:19:42    And if you'll turn over to page 11 and this is shortly before the launch of Oxy cotton, correct. We're now into November of 90. No, it was not. This is over year before the launch. No. Yeah. November of 94. Um, it says in the third paragraph, halfway down that paragraph.  
Speaker 6    03:20:14    Yes, Dr. ER,  
Speaker 2    03:20:15    Dr. Reader, uh, it says advantages for OxyContin are that not all patients can be successfully treated with morphine and that there is a stigma attached to morphine so far as many patients and physicians are concerned. And that stigma is, um, what,  
Speaker 6    03:20:34    It's an end of life in many hands, principally cancer drug, um, associated with a whole bunch of negative associations  
Speaker 2    03:20:46    Were, were one of the negative associations side effects, uh, uh, addiction, dependency, tolerance buildup.  
Speaker 6    03:20:55    Yes, but that the, uh, dependency did not differentiate it from any other opioid. It was not more dependence causing or less.  
Speaker 2    03:21:18    And under this in summary, the efficacy of the product has been demonstrated in, uh, I'm sorry, go to page 12.  
Speaker 6    03:21:25    Okay. Thank you. Okay. What  
Speaker 2    03:21:37    It's therapeutic. Uh, okay.  
Speaker 6    03:21:39    I'm I'm on page road. Can you help me the paragraph third paragraph from the top or bottom?  
Speaker 2    03:21:43    Yeah. Third paragraph from the top, actually fourth. It says in summary.  
Speaker 6    03:21:47    Yes. Thank you.  
Speaker 2    03:21:49    The efficacy of the product has been demonstrated in six double blind clinical trials involving 713 patients. Therapeutic conclusions are the equivalents of one milligram of oxycodone to two milligrams of morphine sulfate.  
Speaker 6    03:22:06    That's correct.  
Speaker 2    03:22:07    All right. Number two says equivalence to IR oxycodone  
Speaker 6    03:22:14    And that immediate release.  
Speaker 2    03:22:15    Yeah. So they're saying controlled release is equivalent to immediate release oxycodone  
Speaker 6    03:22:20    In the implication here is in terms of potency, I assume.  
Speaker 2    03:22:25    Number three was the need for dose titration.  
Speaker 6    03:22:30    Yes.  
Speaker 2    03:22:31    And number four says the need for the availability of a rescue formulation. And number five said the need for aggressive management of side effects. Um, why would you need the availability of a rescue formulation,  
Speaker 6    03:22:49    Um, at this time and still today? Um, the doctrine, uh, of using opioids is to titrate to effect, but in some conditions, cancer and others, the dose that has in general, a good effect may suddenly be insubstantial due to what's called breakthrough pain. And breakthrough pain could be the occasion by movement or trauma, or just occasion by the fluctuation in the pain state, rather than maintaining a patient on the highest number of milligrams of any opioid around the clock, just to prevent breakthrough pain, the normal practice. And I think it's the prudent and safest practice is to give the patient an immediate release form ideally of the same analgesic agent that they can take when they have breakthrough pain on a as needed basis.  
Speaker 2    03:24:05    Were there studies done at Purdue that showed that blood plasma levels that the medication instead of lasting for 12 hours really lasted between eight and 12 hours.  
Speaker 6    03:24:21    There were, there were blood level studies that showed the profile of blood level, but there is no prediction of what blood level you will need to control what pain. So when we, what we attended to were the clinical results of treating patients at a 12 hour basis. And that was what we've researched  
Speaker 2    03:24:51    Now. But  
Speaker 6    03:24:52    What, but may I just go on a little  
Speaker 2    03:24:54    Bit? Sure. Let me ask you this though. What your research actually showed is that OxyContin controlled release provides pain relief somewhere between eight and 12 hours,  
Speaker 6    03:25:02    Correct? I think there were some patients who appeared that way, but principally most were 12 hours. Allow me to just  
Speaker 6    03:25:17    Elaborate just a bit. Normally people take a Tylenol tablet every, or two tablets every four hours, but they will get essentially the same effect. If they take one tablet, every two hours. What we had found was in most patients, this was found as the drug was marketed, who complained that at eight or nine hours, they were back in pain. Yes, they could be treated every three, three times a day. But if you took that dosage daily dose and divided it twice a day, Q 12 hours, they were just as pleased with the pain relief. It was simply that the physician, perhaps by habit or for other reasons, rather than increasing the twice a day dose increase the daily dose by telling the patient, well, take it every eight hours and it would work fine.  
Speaker 2    03:26:23    Do you recall Purdue Pharma running into a real problem with their rescue drug? Because they were trying to decide how to market it and whether to say it was for three to four hours or for six hours. And there was a real debate at the company of how we're gonna market this because we're gonna hurt ourselves one way or the other. Uh, depending on whether we say our rescue drug is three to four versus six, because it's the same and you're marketing it two different ways.  
Speaker 3    03:26:50    Objection to the form of the question. It's, it's consists of multiple questions and parts. You can answer it if you can.  
Speaker 6    03:26:58    Um, I have a vague recollection of it. If you could show me some documents, if you wanted to pursue this with other questions, please show me some documents I have. I have, I do have a very hazy recollection of this very minor complication, but perhaps it was a big regulatory complication. I don't remember. I couldn't explain it to you.  
Speaker 2    03:27:26    So we'll go back to that in a second. Okay. And post, let me read and continue to read from this document. Uh, it says Dr. Keiko reported that file studies. Okay. Yes. It's fourth paragraph,  
Speaker 6    03:27:41    Right?  
Speaker 2    03:27:41    Undertaken to show that the 10 20 and 40 milligram tablets were bio equivalent and dose proportional in normal subjects. It has been demonstrated that at the same total daily dose, the controlled release product, given 12 hourly showed the same twofold fluctuation as the immediate release product, given six hourly, and that this held across the four fold dosage range. And were you all aware of that in 1994?  
Speaker 6    03:28:13    I'm not certain what this means. I'm sorry, but I don't know. I don't know what twofold fluctuation means. I'm sorry.  
Speaker 2    03:28:29    Um, did you ask anybody to when you were at the meeting?  
Speaker 6    03:28:33    I I'm sure I understood it, but I have a, my, my, my best guess is that whoever was taking the minutes somehow, perhaps even didn't understand the discussion or may have understood it, but wrote it up in a way that doesn't make any sense to me right now,  
Speaker 2    03:28:53    Going down to the fifth paragraph, um,  
Speaker 2    03:28:59    A clinical study has been undertaking, comparing oxycodone, BD versus immediate release oxycodone Q I D in patients previously stabilized to pain relief. Um, and then if you drop down the study demonstrated that both products maintained baseline pain control and pain intensity was the same throughout the day. The acceptability score was the same throughout the study and the same for immediate and controlled release products. Uh, and then if you drop down to the next paragraph, uh, the conclusion from the study was that the 12 hour product was equivalent in efficacy to immediate release oxycodone. And is that why the FDA said other than how many times you take the product being the dosing requirements, uh, there's really not any other benefit it.  
Speaker 6    03:29:52    The F I can't tell you why, whether this was the study that convinced the FDA of that. Um, but it's certainly, it's not the finding is completely consistent with that. There may have been other studies that led them to that conclusion with this being just supportive of that conclusion in pain studies. I, I might point out that the biggest advance in measuring pain, which of course is a personal experience. No doctor can look at you and say, oh, you've got a pain level of three, and you have a pain level of six. There's no way of doing it. You have to depend on the patient's report. And the huge advance that led to all the research in analgesia and pain relief was called the McGill visual analog scale that was developed in the fifties in McGill university. Uh, in Montreal,  
Speaker 6    03:31:03    70 years later, we have no advance on that. And needless to say, I suspect everybody in this room has gone to a doctor where they say, do you have pain? And if you say, or to a nurse, when they take your blood pressure, yes, I have pain. And they ask you to rate it. That is clearly better than just saying patient has pain, plus yes or no, but it's not a lot better. It's not terribly, it's not reproducible. And it is highly influenced by the environment and other factors that affect the report that the patient gives. So very often you can compare a highly effective pain reliever to a placebo, and you get in the study, no difference. And that is widely recognized. And that probably related to the study that you talked about earlier, um, the FDA, however, would've required studies that showed a difference and they did before they would approve the product. In other words, the negative didn't was dismissed as a failed study by the FDA, the positive studies control, because  
Speaker 2    03:32:29    Do you recall that study being dismissed, uh,  
Speaker 6    03:32:31    As a policy study, I don't know it was dismissed. It was studied, but they must have concluded that that finding is not consistent with either their expectation or ours, or more importantly, other studies and experience and variance. And clearly the product's success in treating patients in pain, which is indisputable, uh, would put a lie to anybody who would say, oh, oxycodone is no better than placebo. I don't think any doctor would assert that for treating pain. Right. I should say maybe they, maybe they would say in terms of urinary incontinence, it's not effective, but for treating pain,  
Speaker 2    03:33:16    But whether it's effective or not also depends on another other factors, such as abused. I mean, you can kill somebody and take away their pain, but that certainly wouldn't be effective. Would it?  
Speaker 6    03:33:30    I don't think that death would be considered, uh, a sign of efficacy, correct? Yes. I mean, in the extreme, yes. What you say is correct.  
Speaker 2    03:33:44    So just because it takes away pain doesn't mean it's a good drug, does it?  
Speaker 6    03:33:48    No.  
Speaker 2    03:33:48    All right. Let's, let's look at Sackler exhibit 13. Again, I did want to ask you one question about this.  
Speaker 6    03:33:56    There's always a balance between effectiveness. I'm sorry. There's always a balance between effectiveness and safety.  
Speaker 2    03:34:04    If you go to page four, 1.4, it says, if physicians perceive OxyContin as controlled release Percocet, it is likely that they will start to use it in place of oxycodone combinations. As physicians become more comfortable with the use of oxycodone combination market, it is possible. They will start to use OxyContin in place of class three, hydrocodone or codeine combination drugs and class three are not as regulated as class two, correct?  
Speaker 6    03:34:40    That is correct.  
Speaker 2    03:34:42    Therefore, it is imperative that we establish a literature to support such use who at Purdue Pharma was trying to establish a literature to support a class three use for OxyContin,  
Speaker 0    03:34:55    Uh, object to the form of the question.  
Speaker 6    03:35:00    Um, your, the answer to your question is nobody. We had no plan program or expectation that or intention to change OxyContin from class two to class three. In fact, it is not too long ago. The FDA has reclassified hydrocodone as a class, two drug.  
Speaker 0    03:35:29    Okay.  
Speaker 2    03:35:30    So you think that where it says, therefore it is imperative, we establish a literature to support such use as referring to physicians, believing where it says physicians perceive OxyContin as controlled release Percocet. It is likely they will start to use it in place of oxycodone combinations. Is that what that development of literature is referring to in your opinion?  
Speaker 6    03:35:52    Probably.  
Speaker 2    03:35:52    Okay. Who, who was  
Speaker 6    03:35:55    Trying  
Speaker 2    03:35:55    To develop that literature?  
Speaker 6    03:35:57    I don't know that would've been a combination that would've been the medical department to do studies and then, uh, have them published that would've been a research effort.  
Speaker 0    03:36:18    Um,  
Speaker 2    03:36:19    Do you have that? Is that what this is?  
Speaker 6    03:36:23    Are we finished with this one  
Speaker 0    03:36:29    Off the  
Speaker 2    03:36:29    Record? Yeah. You want to break for  
Speaker 0    03:36:31    Between subjects? Did that be a good time to break for lunch? Sure. You want a golf record?  
Speaker 2    03:36:35    Did they bring lunch yet?  
Speaker 0    03:36:36    Yes. It's here. That's knock was, we  
Speaker 2    03:36:38    Are off the record. I thought you, I thought it wasn't. I'm sorry.  
Speaker 1    03:36:44    We are back on the record at 2:03 PM.  
Speaker 0    03:36:49    All right. Uh,  
Speaker 2    03:36:51    Dr. Sackler picking back up, uh, after our break and we've taken a number of breaks, but I'll just remind you at any time you need to stop or, or need a break, just let us know. Thank you. We'll stop again. Um, we were talking earlier about this issue with rescue OxyContin.  
Speaker 0    03:37:14    And  
Speaker 2    03:37:14    Let me hand you what we're gonna mark as  
Speaker 0    03:37:16    Exhibit 2022. And  
Speaker 2    03:37:29    If you go back to the last page, there is a memo dated 9 21 95 from Robert Reeder, R E D E R. And he says currently our draft PI that's package insert, correct?  
Speaker 6    03:37:50    Yes.  
Speaker 2    03:37:51    And therefore our sales material have the same dosing of rescue as Q3 dash four H PN. And, um, that is, um, means what  
Speaker 6    03:38:06    It means every three to four hours as needed.  
Speaker 0    03:38:11    Okay.  
Speaker 2    03:38:13    And do you know if the people who were involved in the studies of OxyContin were given OxyContin, uh, for rescue pain,  
Speaker 6    03:38:24    Oxy OxyContin, yes. Or you mean oxycodone?  
Speaker 2    03:38:28    Oxycodone? I'm sorry.  
Speaker 6    03:38:30    I'm sorry. Uh, I don't know.  
Speaker 2    03:38:36    It says, um, BK brought this issue up some time ago. It is now surfacing again because of the review of our sales material. I else material Oxy IR. And is that oxycodone?  
Speaker 6    03:38:50    Yes.  
Speaker 2    03:38:52    Is being promoted as rescue, uh, to be Q3 four H and that's every three to four hours, right? That's  
Speaker 6    03:39:00    Correct.  
Speaker 2    03:39:01    He said, well, this may be consistent with the OxyContin package insert. If it is approved as stands, it will be inconsistent with the Oxy IR five milligram package insert, which uses Q six H mean take it every six hours. Correct.  
Speaker 6    03:39:19    That's what it means.  
Speaker 2    03:39:21    He says, moreover, if we use the Q3 four hours, it will help to validate Roxanne's change in their package. Insert. Uh, what was the reason that you all did not want to validate Roxanne's change in their package? Insert.  
Speaker 6    03:39:41    I, I would have to read this completely and try to answer your question, but I'm not sure that this will prompt me to remember. May I?  
Speaker 2    03:39:52    Sure.  
Speaker 6    03:39:53    Okay. I really don't remember this well enough to answer your question.  
Speaker 2    03:41:07    Okay. Well, let me continue reading here. It says, finally it creates a problem for the Oxy 10 milligram and 20 milligram capsules. As the package insert would have two different dosing intervals, depending upon the use. Uh, I E Q4 for rescue and Q six for usual pain use, he says one suggestion would be to make everything consistent at Q six hours rescue would then be Q six, PRN as needed as would some acute pain prescriptions for ATC use. It would just Q six hours. Although I hate the thought of recommending a PI change package, insert change. I understand FDA may recommend a change or two such as removing the plasma curve graph. At this point, we could change the frequency of dosing in the PI. What do you guys think? So what he's saying here is we've got the exact same drug. We've marketed it for two different purposes, and we've got two different dosing regimens for the exact same drug, correct?  
Speaker 6    03:42:15    It seems to suggest that, but I can't confirm it.  
Speaker 2    03:42:19    And then Paul Goldenheim, if you turn to the next page and read the next one at the bottom, it says, uh, who is Paul Goldenheim?  
Speaker 6    03:42:34    He was head of R and D research and development and medical.  
Speaker 2    03:42:40    He says the issue that won't go away, Robert is right. We need to discuss again, Robert, please arrange a meeting round up the usual suspects. This is too complicated for email then Friedman. And what was his role?  
Speaker 6    03:42:58    He was head of marketing and sales.  
Speaker 2    03:43:00    The head of marketing and sales writes back and says it is, is it unreasonable to have a Q six H dose meaning take it every six hours for normal dosing and a Q3 four hour for rescue. So the marketing guy's saying, well, Hey, can't we just take the exact same medication and say, if it's for a normal dosing, take it every six hours. But if it's for rescue, take it every three to four hours,  
Speaker 6    03:43:29    That's what he says. And what he meant was for normal around the clock dosing, rather than rescue, which is one or two or three doses. And that's it as needed.  
Speaker 2    03:43:45    And then up at the top, uh, you write back and say a second one down. I agree. This is too complicated to solve through written exchange. Paul, I think that you should get us together soon. Good. Pick up someone. Do you recall writing that email?  
Speaker 6    03:44:02    No, but looks like I wrote  
Speaker 2    03:44:04    It. Okay. And then Robert Keiko writes back and says, unfortunately soon may be too late. Robert question mark as previously. So he's saying I brought this up again as previously. I recommend we change everything to Q six hours for immediate release oxycodone products. And he is the head of what Robert Keiko.  
Speaker 6    03:44:28    He was in the medical department and he was the project, the research project head for the overall OxyContin project. Okay.  
Speaker 2    03:44:38    So he's saying, um, appears to me maybe perhaps to be a little frustrated in saying, uh, soon may be too late. I've as previously I recommend we change everything to Q six hours.  
Speaker 6    03:44:52    I, I, I can't say why he wrote the first sentence, whether he was frustrated or whether he was actually referring to some sort of deadline, maybe in a clinical trial, maybe on submissions to the FDA. I don't know  
Speaker 2    03:45:07    Why, but at least from the appearance of this, you've got Friedman the head of marketing saying, why don't we take the same product and just say, take it every six hours. And if it's for rescue, uh, it's good for three or four hours,  
Speaker 6    03:45:22    Right? Um, this essentially to fill in what the blank here, what his, what he must have meant was have two indications for regular use of immediate release, oxycodone, administer it around the clock. Every six hours for rescue use adminis. You can administer the dose every three to four. Uh, but that wouldn't be indefinite. This would be for rescue  
Speaker 2    03:46:00    And Friedman for  
Speaker 6    03:46:01    Breakthrough, actually for breakthrough pain  
Speaker 2    03:46:03    And Friedman the head of marketing is not a physician, correct?  
Speaker 6    03:46:10    That's correct. So he's making a suggestion. He's  
Speaker 2    03:46:13    Not Dr. Robert Keiko. The head of the project for OxyContin is a physician, correct?  
Speaker 6    03:46:18    He is.  
Speaker 2    03:46:19    And he's saying, don't do what Friedman's saying. We need to make it Q six hours for immediate release oxycodone products. Correct.  
Speaker 6    03:46:27    First of all, Friedman asks a question here. Um, he's not asserting a proposition. He's asking, explain to me why we can't do this. Mm-hmm and I understand why he asked the question and the only answer could be the, it would, it might be confusing to a physician, but I think the emphasis should be on might be confusing. Um <affirmative>  
Speaker 2    03:47:02    And then, uh, you write back the next day and say, I don't know how urgent this is. If it can't wait till tomorrow, let us know immediately. I don't have a problem with this change at all. Does anyone question it? And who's Mr. Alfonso,  
Speaker 6    03:47:17    He was head of marketing at the time.  
Speaker 2    03:47:20    Okay. So the head of marketing comes back and he says, uh, the way these drugs are written are Q4 six. The rescue is for Q3 four hours. And he explains the problem might be that if we go Q3 four hour route, we will validate the Roxanne dosing. Do you, again, I'm gonna ask you, do you know what the problem was with validating the Roxanne dosing and why he thought it was a problem?  
Speaker 6    03:47:48    I don't remember. I don't really think it was a problem. I, I, I can't imagine what he was thinking of.  
Speaker 2    03:47:56    Okay. So he writes, the problem might be that if we go the Q4 Q3 four hour route, we will validate the Roxanne dosing and possibly present a challenge to the OxyContin studies. So if he's validating the Roxanne with a Q3 four, would it appear that perhaps the Roxanne, um, um, had required now that's an overseas company, correct?  
Speaker 6    03:48:26    No. Roxanne was an American company, I believe at that time owned by Behringer Ingelheim.  
Speaker 2    03:48:33    Okay. Did they, um, did, did they put a dosing limit on OxyContin to your knowledge  
Speaker 6    03:48:42    Oxycodone? You  
Speaker 2    03:48:43    Mean on oxycodone?  
Speaker 6    03:48:44    No, not to my knowledge. I don't think it was an issue of limit.  
Speaker 2    03:48:49    Do you know what Roxanne's dosing was that he's referring to?  
Speaker 6    03:48:53    No.  
Speaker 2    03:48:53    Okay. So he says, uh, the problem might be that if we go the Q3 four H route, we will validate the Roxanne dosing and possibly present a challenge to the OxyContin studies. On the other hand, a much more dangerous scenario can occur. If we go the Q six R for maintenance and rescue, if we go this route and price continues to be a major issue when we narrow the value of OxyContin closer to the IRS, and that's immediate releases, is that what that is?  
Speaker 6    03:49:35    Yes. IR be immediate releases. I'm just reading the sentence because I'm not, I didn't follow what it meant.  
Speaker 2    03:49:41    Yeah. You says the next sentence says, in essence, if you can use an IR Q six hours at a cheap price, then those doctors that use OxyContin Q eight hours, there will be some, regardless of what we say or do, will not see a benefit over the immediate releases. In addition, our promotional campaign has a visual six cups representing Q4 hours. If we go Q six hours, we will, might have to change the visual to four cups. And this will not have as much impact. We need to go Q six hours for maintenance and Q3 four hours for rescue so that we can maintain the integrity of our OxyContin studies. Um, did I read that correctly? You did. Do you know whether you went Q uh, three, four hours for rescue, uh, and six hours for maintenance?  
Speaker 6    03:50:39    I don't know. Sorry.  
Speaker 2    03:51:06    All right. Let's uh, let me jump  
Speaker 0    03:51:10    Back. Um,  
Speaker 2    03:51:13    We've  
Speaker 0    03:51:14    I believe we  
Speaker 2    03:51:28    Have another copy of that's little document.  
Speaker 0    03:51:50    Thank you.  
Speaker 2    03:51:52    Why don't we go ahead and mark that as exhibit  
Speaker 0    03:51:55    20 33 23.  
Speaker 2    03:52:01    This is from you dated April 20th, 2000. So OxyContin has been on the market over four years at this point, correct? Yes. And under number five, um, it says OxyContin tablets price increase is the central decision. Every zero 1.1% is one M I'm assuming that's 1 million  
Speaker 6    03:52:28    That's  
Speaker 2    03:52:28    Correct. 1 million to the bottom line. What would the risk of having a 4% increase instead of a, what would the risk be of having a 4% increase instead of a 3% increase? And you're talking about price increase, correct?  
Speaker 6    03:52:42    That's correct.  
Speaker 2    03:52:44    Um, our average realized price is constant suggesting that rebates and other discounts are taking a larger share of our business. 3% annual notional increases seems to hold our per kg. That's is that kilogram  
Speaker 6    03:52:59    Per kilogram  
Speaker 2    03:53:01    Price constant in an environment where many prices are going up? Was it true that every time you increased the price, 0.1%, uh, you added 1 million to the bottom line of Purdue Pharma?  
Speaker 6    03:53:16    I don't remember. Um, the answer is no to your question. I don't remember whether this is correct or not when I wrote it, but it certainly wouldn't have been correct every time.  
Speaker 0    03:53:32    Okay. Um, alright.  
Speaker 2    03:53:40    Did you have that deposition of Friedman? I'm sorry, Shapiro. We were talking earlier about Purdue Frederick versus Purdue Pharma. Did you ever determine whether the employees, the sales force that engaged in improper conduct, um, as referenced in the felony plea agreement, were employees of Purdue Frederick or employees of Purdue Pharma? Well, I  
Speaker 3    03:54:13    Have to object to the form of the question. I don't think it accurately reflects the plea agreement.  
Speaker 6    03:54:23    Could you just restate the question? Cause I kind of lost the thrust, so,  
Speaker 2    03:54:27    Sure. Um, did you ever make a, we've talked about Purdue Pharma and Purdue Frederick. Uh, did you ever make a determination whether the employees who engaged in illegal activity, um, um, as referenced in the felony plea agreement or improper activity as referenced in the felony plea agreement, were employees of Purdue Frederick or employees of Purdue Pharma.  
Speaker 6    03:54:55    I'm not aware of whether such a study was done, um, or anybody focused on that question they may have been done, but you should be, you should think of this, that the felony plea agreement came years after many remedial, you, remedial actions had been taken to retrain everybody to discipline sanction, correct discipline, sanction, or dismiss employees who had behaved improperly and those processes, which started late in 2000 or early 2001 continued right up to the plea agreement. And then after the plea agreement.  
Speaker 2    03:55:46    Sure. Uh, have you looked at the call notes of the reps in Kentucky?  
Speaker 6    03:55:52    I have not seen any, except those that were shown to me, uh, during my preparation, there were three or four that I saw.  
Speaker 2    03:56:03    Okay. Did you review the documents that Mr. Uh, Shapiro, uh, the lawyer that you all hired put together for the, uh, us attorney in Virginia?  
Speaker 6    03:56:17    I don't think so. Those don't seem familiar to  
Speaker 2    03:56:21    Me. And that was the attorney that you all hired to defend you, uh, in the case, uh, brought by the us attorney in Virginia, is that correct? Yes. Um, you all paid him, uh, approximately 50 million, uh, to defend you in that CA or paid his firm approximately 50 million to defend Purdue in that case?  
Speaker 6    03:56:40    I'm I can't verify that's the first time I've heard a number attached to that.  
Speaker 2    03:56:45    Uh, if he testified to that, would you dispute it?  
Speaker 6    03:56:48    I would have no basis to dispute it.  
Speaker 2    03:56:52    Um, and do you know if anybody at Purdue, um, uh, made an effort to determine whether the, the submission, uh, and the, uh, uh, call notes that were pulled by the lawyer hired to represent you were accurate or not?  
Speaker 3    03:57:13    I object to the form because I don't know how anyone knows what it is you're referring to.  
Speaker 2    03:57:21    Um, are, are you aware that he made a submission on behalf of Purdue to the, um, us attorney's office?  
Speaker 6    03:57:30    I am not aware of anything that he's submitted to the us attorney's office.  
Speaker 2    03:57:36    You've not reviewed any of the materials he submitted to the us attorney's office when he was defending Purdue.  
Speaker 6    03:57:42    I did not.  
Speaker 2    03:57:43    Okay. Uh, were you aware of the call notes that he pulled and purported were evidence of improper behavior? Um, uh, on behalf of Purdue salespeople?  
Speaker 6    03:58:00    No.  
Speaker 2    03:58:08    Did anyone at Purdue to your knowledge, Purdue Pharma or Purdue Frederick make any attempt to ascertain? What percentage of reps in Kentucky were engaging in the type of behavior that the plea agreement says was improper?  
Speaker 6    03:58:29    I'm not aware of that.  
Speaker 2    03:58:45    Yeah. Did you ever instruct anybody to do it to, to  
Speaker 6    03:58:49    Do, could you be more  
Speaker 2    03:58:51    Instruct anybody at Purdue to undertake an investigation, uh, to find out what percentage of reps in Kentucky and which ones were engaging in conduct that was referenced as improper in the felony plea agreement?  
Speaker 6    03:59:08    No, I did not.  
Speaker 2    03:59:22    Uh, have you reviewed, hired Shapiro's deposition in this case?  
Speaker 6    03:59:26    I have never seen it.  
Speaker 2    03:59:36    He was asked, um,  
Speaker 2    03:59:39    Let me read this question in, in his answer, Mr. Shell, before the break, we were discussing the agreed statement of five specifically, paragraph 20. One of the questions that I had asked you previously about the conduct described in the agreed statement of facts was, did you ever figure out who the employees referenced in the agreed statement of facts worked for? Was it Purdue Frederick company? Was it Purdue Pharma, LLP, or some other entity with respect to the employees that we've been discussing? And those are employees whose conduct is described in paragraph 20 in its various subparts. Did you ever do a determination to determine whether those employees were employees of Purdue Frederick company who signed the agreed statement of facts or some other Purdue entity? And his answer is without going into too much work product. Let me state, we did sufficient investigation once,  
Speaker 2    04:00:31    Once it turned this direction to satisfy ourselves and our client, that there were Purdue Frederick employees who engaged in the conduct, that's referenced in here. And that forms the basis for the guilty plea question. Were there any employees of Purdue Pharma LP that are referenced here or any other Purdue entity answered? Well, again, and I'm just what I said before. The, I don't know whether at, at which point in time, Michael Friedman hired UDel, Paul Goldenheim, whether they were Purdue farmer or Purdue Frederick, or some of the, some of them had been won. And then the other beyond them, there were, when we look for instance, at the names that are associated with the, in the first supplemental responses to whatever that was 23, I think. Did you understand that answer?  
Speaker 3    04:01:22    Uh, Mr. Mr. Thompson, I object to the question, plus, could you let the witness have a copy to read because it's very hard to follow when you're reading such a lengthy.  
Speaker 2    04:01:32    Sure. Do we have another question? Some  
Speaker 0    04:01:34    Answers up real quick  
Speaker 2    04:01:39    Here. I'll tell why you can just read along with me if you want to do that. I'll hold it over  
Speaker 6    04:01:42    Here. No, I think he would like  
Speaker 3    04:01:43    To say it well. I'd like to see it also. He, he really can't see, see that distance just physically it's  
Speaker 0    04:01:49    Here. We'll some chunk chunk stay on the record.  
Speaker 2    04:02:08    Um, yeah. Why don't we go off the record? Why don't we get some copies of this?  
Speaker 0    04:02:12    We are off the record at 2:28 PM. We are back on the record at 2:29 PM.  
Speaker 2    04:02:18    Sure. And to save time, I'll let you read it. Can you start with the next question, which was Ah-huh and read the answer.  
Speaker 6    04:02:27    I'll read the answer. The aha. Doesn't really set up the answer for me.  
Speaker 3    04:02:31    That's page two 14, line 27, the aha,  
Speaker 6    04:02:38    2017.  
Speaker 3    04:02:41    Yes. I'm sorry. Page  
Speaker 6    04:02:46    2, 2, 1, 4 14  
Speaker 3    04:02:49    Line 17, right? Okay.  
Speaker 6    04:02:53    Oh, uh, is the question answer of people who are refer referenced, but not named in some of the paragraphs? I don't believe that we made any effort to determine whether at the relevant times they were Purdue Frederick company, employees, or Purdue Pharma employees.  
Speaker 0    04:03:15    Okay.  
Speaker 2    04:03:21    And is that testimony accurate?  
Speaker 6    04:03:24    I can't, uh, I, I can't vouch that it's accurate. It's consistent with my knowledge.  
Speaker 2    04:03:30    So the next question says, so it could have been either or one or both.  
Speaker 6    04:03:44    Yes. He said the question is, so it could have been one or either or both. You're not sure. And the answer is correct. Yeah.  
Speaker 2    04:03:57    Now in 2001, who did Michael Friedman work for?  
Speaker 6    04:04:04    I don't know.  
Speaker 2    04:04:05    You don't know if he worked for Purdue Pharma in 2001?  
Speaker 6    04:04:08    My best guess is he worked for Purdue Frederick, but it's a guess. And maybe for Purdue Pharma, but I don't really know.  
Speaker 2    04:04:17    How about Howard UDel? Do you know who he worked for?  
Speaker 6    04:04:20    No.  
Speaker 2    04:04:21    What about Paul Goldenheim? Do you  
Speaker 6    04:04:23    Know who he worked for? I don't. I don't know that.  
Speaker 2    04:04:35    Do you know whether you worked for Purdue Pharma or Purdue Frederick in 2001?  
Speaker 6    04:04:39    I don't know for sure.  
Speaker 2    04:04:46    All right. You have this one. So, um, going back to our OxyContin launch team, that's what I'm. Um, okay. I don't think its that's I'm sorry. Yes. The last one that can we do that?  
Speaker 6    04:06:07    Did you want to put a number on  
Speaker 2    04:06:08    This? Yes, let's mark that as exhibit  
Speaker 6    04:06:12    25 25.  
Speaker 2    04:06:19    And I've just got a couple of paragraphs when I ask you. So, uh, this is dated April 4th, 1995. Um, and it says at the first paragraph second sentence, Mike Innerato. Oops.  
Speaker 6    04:07:03    First paragraph on which page?  
Speaker 2    04:07:05    I'm sorry. Uh, page one second paragraph.  
Speaker 6    04:07:10    Oh, second paragraph.  
Speaker 2    04:07:11    Okay. Mike Innerato he's the marketing guy again, correct?  
Speaker 6    04:07:15    Yes.  
Speaker 2    04:07:16    Discuss the marketplace that OxyContin will enter and how OxyContin will expand out of the cancer pain market. Um, OxyContin will be launched in 10 20, 40 milligram tablet, strength, 80 and 160 milligram tablet, strength to follow. Um, and if you go on down a little bit further, he says OxyContin will be indicated for the relief of pain with the convenience of Q 12 dosing Oxycontin's primary market positioning will be for cancer pain, and the secondary market will be for non-malignant pain, musculoskeletal injury and trauma. It was reinforced that we do not want to niche OxyContin just for cancer pain. Um, and <affirmative> um, and was it, um, part of your all's marketing strategy, not to niche OxyContin for cancer pain,  
Speaker 6    04:08:13    Not to limit it? Yes.  
Speaker 2    04:08:17    Below that it says, uh, on the last paragraph in our market research office, focus groups, personal one-on-one interviews and telephone interviews were conducted with more than 500 healthcare professionals in our focus group findings. We learned that Ms. Cotton that's the drug that you already sold, correct?  
Speaker 6    04:08:37    I'm sorry, I didn't hear the  
Speaker 2    04:08:38    Question. Yes. That's morphine sulfate, correct? Yes. Um, that's the one that you had not had any reports of abuse or diversion with that you could recall,  
Speaker 6    04:08:48    Correct? None that I was aware of.  
Speaker 2    04:08:50    Yes. And it says, we learned that MS. Contin is the gold standard for cancer pain. Our creative concept testing showed the likelihood of OxyContin usage by physician and nurses were 4.6 on a scale of one to five, which is very favorable. Um, were you aware of this, uh, creative concept testing and focus groups that were being conducted?  
Speaker 6    04:09:13    I don't recall.  
Speaker 2    04:09:17    And then if you go to the next page, page two, last paragraph,  
Speaker 2    04:09:26    Our meeting ended with a question and comment period. Michael Friedman emphasized the threat that AB rated generics posed to MS. Contin. We're not sure when AB rated generics will be launched, but we don't think it will be until 1996. Inevitably the AB rated generics will arrive. And this is why it is extremely timely importance that we must establish OxyContin. OxyContin can cure the vulnerability of the AB rated generic threat. And that is why it is so crucial that we devote our fullest efforts now to a successful launch of OxyContin. And were you aware that was part of the strategy?  
Speaker 6    04:10:03    What I'm sorry, but what was part of the strategy,  
Speaker 2    04:10:07    Uh, that the AB rated generics were going to arrive and that, uh, is why it was extremely timely important. That's the way it's written that we must establish OxyContin. Uh, and it was crucial to devote the fullest efforts to a successful launch, um, be because of AB Reagan, generic  
Speaker 0    04:10:28    Objection, objections to the form. The witness can answer.  
Speaker 6    04:10:34    Yes. Um, I was aware of that and the reason is clear and us comp was our most important product at that point. And when the sales were eroded and by generics, we would have, I, if we had not replaced those sales with other product sales, we would have a much smaller company that would cost many people, their jobs.  
Speaker 0    04:11:07    Do you,  
Speaker 2    04:11:31    Are you familiar with the OxyContin product team  
Speaker 6    04:11:36    I've become reminded of it? Yes.  
Speaker 2    04:11:46    Let's mark this as exhibit,  
Speaker 0    04:11:48    Is it 20 25 5. Thank you.  
Speaker 2    04:11:58    And this is, uh, minutes of the OxyContin product team dated. Uh, the meeting is February 22nd, 1996. Um, up at  
Speaker 6    04:12:12    Washington Washington's birthday.  
Speaker 2    04:12:15    It says first paragraph, the OxyContin product team met on Friday, February 22nd, 1996. And topics discussion included the following number one is marketing's wishlist for clinical studies. Uh, and then it's got a list of studies. Uh, number one is post-operative pain to support the Abbott agreement. Why did you need studies on post-operative pain to support the Abbott  
Speaker 6    04:12:45    Agreement? I don't recall.  
Speaker 2    04:12:50    Uh pharmacoeconomic what was the reason for pharmacoeconomic studies being needed? If you recall?  
Speaker 6    04:13:02    I don't recall that circumstance.  
Speaker 2    04:13:06    And then it says non-malignant pain exam example, functional improvement, and then the subcategories are low back pain, osteoarthritis long-term safety data.  
Speaker 6    04:13:21    Right.  
Speaker 2    04:13:22    Why did you think that marketing needed was needing on March 7th, 1996 after the product had already launched long term safety data?  
Speaker 6    04:13:36    I don't remember precisely, but all studies would include or would enhance the, um, data available to support long term safety. Um, if the studies were long term and the studies that were referenced here low back pain and osteoarthritis would surely have been long enough to add to that database.  
Speaker 2    04:14:06    Sure. Then can you explain why the head of the OxyContin or the, uh, OxyContin product team on February 22nd, 1996, after the product launched said we need long-term safety data term safety down.  
Speaker 6    04:14:25    I, I don't think there was any question about the safety of the drug. It was just an addition that it would enhance the Dosier that was available. I don't know how you would do a long term safety study devoid of some condition. So the long term study would be focused on following, uh, a condition let's say low back pain or, um, or osteoarthritis. And at that time, the studies were typically 12 weeks. And with, with an open extension at the end, I could go on for a year.  
Speaker 2    04:15:14    And this that is a subcategory of non-malignant pain, correct.  
Speaker 6    04:15:21    These two studies, low back pain and osteoarthritis mm-hmm <affirmative>, uh, long-term safety would be, uh, a general concept that would apply to any kind of study that's long enough to accumulate that data  
Speaker 2    04:15:36    They've included long-term safety data under their marketing wishlist under nonmalignant pain. Correct? They did. So it looks like they're saying we need long-term safety data on prescribing OxyContin for non-malignant pain. Do you read that the same way or differently?  
Speaker 6    04:15:53    I, I guess I read it differently than you do. Um, just that it wasn't that we, we needed it. It was a wishlist, but it was inherent in any long-term study we did of any pain condition.  
Speaker 2    04:16:07    And then we talked about the FDA's, um,  
Speaker 0    04:16:13    Um,  
Speaker 2    04:16:15    Statement about comparative studies. Um, did, do you remember that where they said you should refrain from comparative analysis of, uh, analysis?  
Speaker 6    04:16:24    I, I don't remember. So if you could just go forward with the question, that  
Speaker 2    04:16:30    Would be great. Um, one of the things that the OxyContin marketing team's wishlist has under number five is comparative studies, especially versus combination opioid <affirmative>, combination opioids, such as hydrocodone combinations. Duragesic MS. Contin Casian and Tran NSAIDs. Those are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Is that  
Speaker 6    04:16:52    Right? Uh, T ultra is an opioid drug. NSAIDs are nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs,  
Speaker 2    04:17:00    Right? Insects.  
Speaker 6    04:17:01    So they're not the same. I, I don't know why they were the bullet put them together, but they're different,  
Speaker 2    04:17:07    Right? No, no, I get it. I'm just, I'm asking you, is that what NSAID stands  
Speaker 6    04:17:11    For?  
Speaker 2    04:17:16    Has that been marked?  
Speaker 6    04:17:18    This been marked 25.  
Speaker 2    04:17:19    All right. Now let's go to the launch plan. And this is dated September 27th, 1995. And if you'll go to page 42 of the launch plan  
Speaker 2    04:17:57    Under 5 8, 5, 1 under public relations at the top, it says the objective of the public relations campaign is to create broad awareness of the launch of OxyContin. This awareness will be directed at the consumer and healthcare professionals through various media channels, such as print, TV, and radio in an effort to create a quote media hook in quote that would coincide with the launch of OxyContin. A consumer survey conducted by a company such as the Gallup pole is being proposed. This survey would focus on the prevalence and problems of chronic pain, both malignant and nonmalignant. The release of the results of such a survey would be publicized along with the recent FDA approval of the new controlled release, oxycodone preparation, OxyContin. This is a classic problem solution strategy to create a need for the launch of a product such as OxyContin. Did I read that correctly?  
Speaker 6    04:19:00    You did. Do  
Speaker 2    04:19:01    You know if a poll was conducted by someone such as the Gallup poll?  
Speaker 6    04:19:06    I don't know what the poll is precisely.  
Speaker 2    04:19:12    Then, then the next paragraph says 5 8, 5 2. It says in an effort to continue the publicity about the launch of OxyContin, approximately two to three months after the initial public relations campaign, another campaign would be launched focusing on the expansion of Purdue Frederick's partners against pain program developed to improve pain management knowledge among healthcare professionals and patients, caregivers, partners against pain was a creation of Purdue Frederick. Correct.  
Speaker 6    04:19:45    That's what it says.  
Speaker 2    04:19:46    And there were no partners, correct?  
Speaker 6    04:19:50    No, I think there were partners meaning of the campaign, physicians, nurses, other healthcare workers or our partners.  
Speaker 2    04:20:01    Oh, okay. So, but as far as setting it up, there weren't any other partners, uh, involved in setting up partners against pain. I mean, the government wasn't involved in partners against pain, other healthcare companies weren't  
Speaker 6    04:20:13    Involved. I don't know whether other healthcare companies were involved, but the government would not have been involved in setting up this program.  
Speaker 2    04:20:27    And it says this campaign would reiterate the prevalence and problems uncovered in the consumer survey and explain how Purdue Frederick has made a commitment to improving the level of care for patient suffering and pain. In addition, the campaign would expand the recent launch of Purdue Frederick's newest partner against pain OxyContin. Um,  
Speaker 3    04:20:50    Excuse me. I, I think you just meant an area in reading you said would explain not would expand.  
Speaker 2    04:20:56    I thought I said explain, but, um, and then the next paragraph says, in addition to the public relations campaigns, we are exploring the possibility of Purdue Frederick sponsoring a pain management foundation in association with an organization such as Gilda's club. Uh, do you know if you sponsored a pain management foundation?  
Speaker 6    04:21:24    I do not, but I, I, no, I don't. I don't know if we did that. I don't think we did, but that's a vague recollection.  
Speaker 2    04:21:43    Can we agree that the main way you marketed your and promoted OxyContin was with your sales force?  
Speaker 6    04:21:51    Yes.  
Speaker 2    04:21:52    And those are the people that actually go out to the physician's offices and pharmacies and to the communities and sell OxyContin. Correct.  
Speaker 6    04:21:59    They don't actually sell, but they promote OxyContin. Okay. The distinction being that they don't actually take orders and arrange deliveries and collect any money.  
Speaker 2    04:22:11    Okay. And you would consider them the most valuable resource that Purdue had to sell OxyContin, correct?  
Speaker 6    04:22:21    It was the most valuable resource that we used. We thought it was the most efficient resource. And that's why we used them. Whether other approaches or resources would've been more valuable. I can't say.  
Speaker 2    04:22:37    Um, <affirmative> um, at some point, did you figure out that the key to getting physicians to prescribe and keep prescribing OxyContin was through regular visits from the Salesforce.  
Speaker 6    04:22:49    That would be typical of any pharmaceutical Salesforce. Yes.  
Speaker 2    04:22:54    And was there a realization that developed that certain physicians so-called core physicians were more likely to prescribe OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    04:23:04    I'm not sure. Uh, it, I, it wasn't, I, I think it was the other way around our core. Our most significant prescribers were called core. Not that we identified a core and then they became, uh, important prescribers.  
Speaker 0    04:23:26    Okay.  
Speaker 2    04:23:31    And how many companies were sending sales representatives to physicians, offices to talk to them about opioids during this time?  
Speaker 6    04:23:56    Three to five. It's a guess on my part. I don't recall any survey that counted that up, but it's a guess based upon my recollection of what was being actively promoted  
Speaker 2    04:24:14    And you compensated your sales force, um, very well based predominantly on how much OxyContin they sold, is that correct?  
Speaker 6    04:24:24    The successful, the most successful sales people, uh, a majority of their income was bonus. Um, the average salesman. Um, I certainly, when we launched the product, uh, the overwhelming majority of their income was their salary, uh, and the benefits that they received, uh, and for the average sales force salesman, I think it would've been 50% of their income or 70% of their income salary and the balance and bonus. Sure. But I'm, I don't, I don't remember this in detail. Of course it changed over  
Speaker 2    04:25:08    Time. The way the sales scheme was set up. If they sold more OxyContin, they made more money, basically.  
Speaker 6    04:25:14    Yes, yes. The same as almost every other company in the industry.  
Speaker 2    04:25:24    And then you all gave your reps an additional incentive because you Des them to sell Ms. Cotton, but you increased the incentive for selling OxyContin. Is that true?  
Speaker 6    04:25:35    Yes.  
Speaker 2    04:25:37    And then you had one of the highest paid sales forces in the country. Is that accurate?  
Speaker 6    04:25:45    I've heard that said for one or two years, it certainly wasn't the case, or hasn't been the case during the history of OxyContin.  
Speaker 2    04:25:53    Do you know if reps that promoted and sold OxyContin, um, sometimes ended up making over $250,000 a year?  
Speaker 6    04:26:01    I've heard that that was the case. I'm sure it was unusual.  
Speaker 2    04:26:06    And then your top sellers were rewarded with trips, uh, to, um, Bermuda or London in what was called the toppers program. Is that  
Speaker 6    04:26:16    Correct?  
Speaker 2    04:26:19    Yes. And during the first five years of OxyContin release Purdue, more than double the size of its sales  
Speaker 6    04:26:25    Force, correct? That's  
Speaker 2    04:26:29    Correct. And do you know how much of this sales force during the first five years was Purdue Frederick versus Purdue Pharma employees?  
Speaker 6    04:26:36    I don't know  
Speaker 0    04:26:41    Every new person would've,  
Speaker 2    04:26:46    Um, at some point were salespeople designated, uh, all new hires, designated Purdue Pharma, as opposed to Purdue Frederick.  
Speaker 6    04:26:59    I believe that that's the case.  
Speaker 2    04:27:01    Okay. But you're not sure what date that started.  
Speaker 6    04:27:04    No.  
Speaker 2    04:27:05    Do you know if it was after the creation of Purdue Pharma that that started  
Speaker 6    04:27:09    It would've had to have been, if Purdue Pharma didn't exist, we couldn't have hired somebody. Right.  
Speaker 2    04:27:15    But I mean, was it immediately after that, that all, once it was created, all reps were hired by Purdue Pharma as opposed to Purdue?  
Speaker 6    04:27:22    Frederick? I don't know.  
Speaker 2    04:27:24    Who would know that at Purdue.  
Speaker 6    04:27:31    I don't know. At Purdue now, yes. At Purdue Pharma, you mean? Yes. Um, well, the people who were there at that time, um, might recall it, but I don't know who today would know it.  
Speaker 0    04:27:51    Okay.  
Speaker 2    04:27:52    And then in addition to targeting, um, while providing initiatives to the sales force, you also targeted wholesalers, correct?  
Speaker 6    04:28:07    Wholesalers were called upon by the salesman. Yes.  
Speaker 2    04:28:13    And in fact, I think if you go to page 27 of the initial launch plan, the last paragraph, um, yeah. Um, it says, um, all promotional efforts for the retail distribution of OxyContin will focus on the incredible success that Purdue Frederick has achieved and sustained with Ms. Cotton product line, wholesale pharmaceutical buyers and retail pharmacists should be reminded of how Ms. Cotton created such a large market for the use of sustained release opioids in the, for the treatment of pain. This in turn created profits for pharmacists, helping to grow their businesses. Promotional copies should focus on the market potential for OxyContin and patient populations to be targeted, including the number of prescriptions written for class two and class three opioids every year.  
Speaker 0    04:29:43    Um,  
Speaker 2    04:29:45    The executive director of national accounts should work with drug wholesalers in developing programs to utilize the wholesaler sales representatives to ensure adequate distribution consideration should begin given to advertisements in drug wholesaler, ad books and computer programs, um, were the sales force told to emphasize with pharmacists that they could make more money, uh, with OxyContin prescriptions.  
Speaker 6    04:30:19    I don't think that they would've been encouraged to say that, um, the objective when any product is launched and certainly any medicine is launched is to be, is to minimize the number of times a patient number of patients who get prescriptions from their doctor and go to the pharmacy. And the pharmacist says I don't have that or even worse. I never heard of that  
Speaker 6    04:30:55    For obvious reasons. So in order to reduce that one tries to stock all three strengths in as many pharmacies as possible, but to begin with there's no demand. So it's a, there's a bit of tension there in order to supply the pharmacists. The wholesalers have to have enough stock on hand for the ones who buy it early and a sufficient backup stock, both to supply the early buyers and the later adopters. And that was all that we needed to accomplish. And there's not much more I can say about it, except that however we did, it was ethical and proper.  
Speaker 2    04:31:47    And let me go back to my question where it says wholesale pharmaceutical buyers and retail pharmacists should be reminded of how Ms. Cotton created such a large market for the use of sustained release opioids for the treatment of pain. This in turn created profits for pharmacists. Um, am I reading that incorrectly? Sorry.  
Speaker 6    04:32:07    You're reading it  
Speaker 2    04:32:08    Correctly. Yeah. What you're telling, uh, what this launch plan Salesforce under the title, Salesforce allocation, um, uh, and representative delivered promotional materials is saying, Hey, remind 'em, they're making a bunch of money selling our product,  
Speaker 6    04:32:26    Is that as opposed to not selling any product?  
Speaker 0    04:32:30    Okay.  
Speaker 2    04:32:35    Um, says a cooperative direct mail advertising sales sheet, offering a rebate on the initial order of OxyContin to retail. Pharmacists will be mailed every month during the first three months of lunch. What was the rebate? You all were offering to pharmacist  
Speaker 6    04:32:54    Some discount on their early orders to encourage them to stock the product in advance of seeing any prescriptions or one or two prescriptions. Um, and like the rest of there was nothing innovative in this program. This is, this was standard programming in the pharmaceutical industry and in other industries.  
Speaker 2    04:33:23    Well, like some of your other literature talks about you all had an unprecedented marketing campaign. Uh, have you ever seen another company that instituted a more broad ranging marketing campaign than you all did for OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    04:33:38    I, I think this was conventional unprecedented, perhaps for us, but not unprecedented in the industry. This was, this is conventional standard textbook. This is how you do it.  
Speaker 2    04:33:54    All right. Um, you all also were involved with third party organizations, uh, partners in pain. Um, they were, uh, referenced in the launch campaign. Um, and did you use partners in pain to drum up demand for OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    04:34:33    No. I, I think the partners in pain was principally designed to inform doctors about the proper use of our drugs, um, our medicines, and to encourage patients who may have had pain sometimes for years, inadequately treated or not treated at all to present themselves to their physicians  
Speaker 2    04:35:26    That later there was also, um, Purdue funded, a variety of so-called pain societies. The American pain societies was that funded by a Purdue Pharma.  
Speaker 6    04:35:43    Uh, we donated money to the American pain society.  
Speaker 2    04:35:47    Did, did you also fund the American association for pain management?  
Speaker 6    04:35:53    If it wouldn't surprise me? I don't remember.  
Speaker 2    04:35:56    Did you also fund the Appalachian pain society?  
Speaker 6    04:36:03    I don't know that and I wouldn't have known it, but if that's what the record shows, it wouldn't surprise me.  
Speaker 2    04:36:10    Yeah. There was a figure we looked at a while ago that said there was basically the target market for physicians was about 7,500 physicians, including the cancer, malignant pain and the non-malignant pain, uh, across the us. Do you remember seeing that?  
Speaker 6    04:36:33    No.  
Speaker 2    04:36:34    Do you think the market was more than 7,500 physicians,  
Speaker 6    04:36:37    Much  
Speaker 2    04:36:37    Larger for pain,  
Speaker 6    04:36:39    Much larger it's pain is the most common presenting symptom for physicians in total. And very few physicians would have a different experience, perhaps ophthalmologists or dermatologists may, but every other physician, it would be the most common or the second most common presenting complaint.  
Speaker 2    04:37:06    Do you recall whether Purdue Pharma set up a speakers bureau in which it allowed physicians, uh, who were recommended by salespeople to be put on the so-called speakers bureau?  
Speaker 6    04:37:20    They, yes. Such a program existed, not everybody who was recommended was put on the speakers bureau. They were vetted by internal, uh, experts to determine their qualifications.  
Speaker 2    04:37:38    Do you recall that there were over 3000 physicians on the speaker's bureau?  
Speaker 6    04:37:42    I don't recall it, but it wouldn't surprise me.  
Speaker 2    04:37:46    Do you think somebody vetted all 3000 physicians that were internally that were on the speakers bureau?  
Speaker 6    04:37:51    We had quite a large organization to do that and to manage the SP the speakers bureau. So I think everyone was, should have been vetted. There was, there was no excuse for not validating their degrees and confirming that they were licensed to practice in the place that they were practicing and so forth. I don't know, uh, precisely how they were vetted, but they definitely should have all been vetted.  
Speaker 2    04:38:22    Do you think putting these 3000 doctors on your speaker's bureau, um, caused them to write more prescriptions for OxyContin or less prescriptions for OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    04:38:32    I don't think it would've had an effect.  
Speaker 2    04:38:39    And there were also individuals, you started a program called train the trainers where you would fly physicians around the country, uh, to speak, uh, on perhaps on behalf of Purdue. Do you recall that,  
Speaker 6    04:38:53    Uh, actually the, the physicians who attended, um, and spoke were trainers and some of them were in house people and some were outside physicians. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um,  
Speaker 2    04:39:11    And would these take place at resorts, like in Florida and Arizona, these meetings  
Speaker 6    04:39:15    Certainly might have,  
Speaker 2    04:39:19    And you also,  
Speaker 6    04:39:20    But, but, but to my knowledge, I, I don't think anybody would go more than once and they were trained in what they could say, what they couldn't say. And they were given, um, materials to use in the presentations for a while slides. And then I guess eventually PowerPoint presentations. So as to create some control to see, hopefully that they would not go off label.  
Speaker 2    04:39:49    And did Purdue pay for that or did they pay their own way  
Speaker 6    04:39:52    At the time it was started Purdue paid for it. This was again customary in the industry, um,  
Speaker 2    04:40:01    Who told you that was customary in the industry?  
Speaker 6    04:40:06    I don't remember who told me, but I can tell you that sometimes I go to hotels and I'd see events sponsored by Pfizer or sponsored by J and J. And they were precisely either they were speaking engagements in which somebody spoke. And occasionally they were trained the trainer kind of ideas where the company, in question, other companies, in that case, um, trained physicians, you can say this and this and this be where you shouldn't say that. And that, and that,  
Speaker 2    04:40:43    Do you know whether pharmaceutical companies and medical device companies have come under criticism for giving incentives to doctors to write prescriptions, uh, or use their medical  
Speaker 6    04:40:55    Devices? I'm aware of that.  
Speaker 2    04:40:58    And the answer is they have come under criticism for that.  
Speaker 6    04:41:01    Yes.  
Speaker 2    04:41:03    Um,  
Speaker 6    04:41:04    I,  
Speaker 2    04:41:07    Yeah. Was Russell Portnoy, one of the speakers that spoke on behalf of Purdue Pharma at these  
Speaker 6    04:41:13    Meetings? OxyContin. Yes. I don't know.  
Speaker 2    04:41:18    Um, in addition to the stuff we've just talked about, you also hired a number of third parties to assist in the marketing of OxyContin, such as marketing firms, correct?  
Speaker 6    04:41:31    I don't know.  
Speaker 2    04:41:32    Uh, do you know if Purdue retained lion's levy to market OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    04:41:39    I've heard the name, but I don't know that it was OxyContin.  
Speaker 2    04:41:43    Do you know if public relation firms were also hired to assist in the marketing? Uh, and the no  
Speaker 6    04:41:49    Don't of the marketing? I don't know.  
Speaker 2    04:41:51    Okay. You gotta, let me finish my question.  
Speaker 6    04:41:53    Oh, sorry. Excuse me.  
Speaker 2    04:41:54    That's okay. You, you we've got a video, but we also have a court reporter's stenographer taking.  
Speaker 6    04:41:59    I'm sorry. That's all apologies.  
Speaker 2    04:42:01    She can't get it if we both talk the same time. So my question is, do you know, um, can you read my question back?  
Speaker 12    04:42:15    Do you know if public public relations firms were also hired to assist in the marketing and the expansion of the market  
Speaker 2    04:42:21    For OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    04:42:22    I don't know. Okay.  
Speaker 0    04:42:24    Um,  
Speaker 2    04:42:27    Have you heard of a company called Fleshman Hilliard?  
Speaker 6    04:42:33    That's a vaguely familiar name, but I don't know whether they were ever hired by Purdue Frederick or for Purdue Pharma.  
Speaker 2    04:42:45    Do you recall at some point being notified of a problem with, um, abuse occurring with OxyContin and Purdue Pharma hiring a crisis management firm?  
Speaker 6    04:43:02    Yes.  
Speaker 2    04:43:03    Do you recall when that crisis management firm was hired?  
Speaker 6    04:43:07    I don't recall. Precisely. No.  
Speaker 2    04:43:20    Have you ever read the interview Michael Friedman gave to the crisis management firm?  
Speaker 6    04:43:26    No.  
Speaker 2    04:43:29    And in addition to all that, you also put out videos. Are you familiar with the, I got my life back video.  
Speaker 6    04:43:36    I've heard the title. I'm not familiar with it.  
Speaker 2    04:43:39    Uh, did you ever do any follow up to find out whether the participants in there? I got my life back video actually got their life back or wound up having problems with, um, dependency on OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    04:43:53    No, I did not.  
Speaker 2    04:43:58    Uh, did Purdue also give away coupons so people could get a weeks free supply of OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    04:44:05    I don't know, but that would be common in the industry. Okay.  
Speaker 2    04:44:12    And all of the things we've just discussed would be done, um, these marketing efforts to sell more OxyContin, correct con correct.  
Speaker 6    04:44:21    To C2 it, that appropriate patients had access to OxyContin. Yes.  
Speaker 2    04:44:36    Um, were you aware that there was a direct link between the number of sales representatives that were out promoting OxyContin and how much OxyContin would be prescribed?  
Speaker 6    04:44:51    Could you just ask that  
Speaker 2    04:44:52    Again? Yeah. Was there a link, a direct link between the number of sales representatives that were out promoting OxyContin and how much OxyContin would be prescribed?  
Speaker 6    04:45:02    I don't think direct link would capture the, the concept. Uh, so the answer is no.  
Speaker 2    04:45:11    Do you believe that the number of sales representatives that promoted OxyContin, uh, would increase, uh, the more sales represent representatives that promoted OxyContin? The more prescriptions would be written?  
Speaker 6    04:45:32    I don't think anybody thought of it that way. We had a product that had tremendous potential. And our principle means of getting it used, was to convince physicians, iden convince physicians that he had in his practice, appropriate patients to use it. But there, the linkage there is very loose.  
Speaker 2    04:46:04    Was there also a correlation between the number of times a sales representative called on a physician to how much OxyContin that physician would prescribe?  
Speaker 6    04:46:17    Again, that would be a loose correlation and there would be clearly if he called not at all, there'd be nothing to correlate. And I am sure there was a practical limit as to how many calls he could make. I don't know whether there was any kind of specific relationship between calling every quarter or every month or more frequently or less frequently.  
Speaker 2    04:46:49    Why don't we mark the OxyContin lodge plan as 27, 26? I'm sorry.  
Speaker 3    04:46:59    It's  
Speaker 2    04:47:05    This is for you. This is for you. This is gonna be  
Speaker 6    04:47:08    27 7.  
Speaker 3    04:47:28    Mr. Thompson. I note on exhibit 27. Um, there's some material that's been good deal of material. That's been bracketed. And I've seen that in other documents that you've marked my son throughout is that the brackets were not on the original. And this is something that you guys added that's incorrect connection with  
Speaker 14    04:47:46    Reading. Yeah. The brackets were produced that way.  
Speaker 3    04:47:48    It came to you with the brackets,  
Speaker 14    04:47:49    These documents that have writing on 'em were produced that way. If the email ends and it's only half an email, that's also the way that they were produced to us.  
Speaker 3    04:47:58    And what if, what if the document was highlighted in yellow? Was it produced to you?  
Speaker 14    04:48:02    It was highlighted in the context that I just gave it to them. I would've added that highlighting just now, but in terms of attachments that aren't connected to the emails that's cuz we didn't get them from Purdue. Okay.  
Speaker 3    04:48:13    I'm mention sure. You about the, about the brackets. Explain to you  
Speaker 2    04:48:16    Tony it's okay. Brackets were, uh, were not adding, so, okay. Thank you. Uh, Sackler exhibit 27. And this is an email from you phase four OxyContin team minutes dated 10 23 96.  
Speaker 6    04:48:35    Oh, you have the one. Okay.  
Speaker 2    04:48:37    And uh, you have a copy of it. Um, and okay. And so this would've been after the launch of OxyContin, correct?  
Speaker 6    04:48:48    Yes.  
Speaker 2    04:48:49    Okay. And it says here, um, Michael, the Oxy men 12 said, what was the Oxy men 12?  
Speaker 6    04:49:00    I don't know,  
Speaker 0    04:49:09    Um,  
Speaker 2    04:49:09    Reef that it says results showed the following physicians who attended the dinner programs or the weekend meetings wrote more than double the number of new prescriptions for OxyContin compared to the control group. And this was sustained over the three month post meeting evaluation period weekend meetings had the greatest impact increasing new prescriptions for OxyContin by a factor between 2.16 and 2.62. These results will be presented in more detail at a later date. This is very encouraging. Although I must allow that a proportion of the percentage without the associated absolute numbers is inherent inherently meaningless was the number of increased prescriptions, commercially significant. If so, what would the cost per increased prescription be assuming that the absolute difference persisted, when will a more complete report be available and, um, was that your, um,  
Speaker 6    04:50:11    You read it correctly.  
Speaker 2    04:50:15    Did you ever get a more complete report?  
Speaker 6    04:50:18    I don't remember.  
Speaker 2    04:50:26    And then above that, it looks like Alfonz writes back to you. And Alfonz was  
Speaker 6    04:50:32    Alfonso.  
Speaker 2    04:50:33    Alfonso was head of marketing.  
Speaker 6    04:50:34    He was head of marketing  
Speaker 2    04:50:36    And he says interesting comments from Dr. Richard. I also wonder if there was a bias in the form of representatives increasing calls to the selected physicians. Would we get the same ROI? Is that return on investment? Yes. In prescriptions. Sorry. Would we get the same return on investment in prescriptions as a result of the representatives increasing the call rate to the selected group, regardless of dinners, I don't have the list. Therefore, I don't know if there was a selected preference toward this group in the part of the reps. It's reasonable that these core doctors were already receiving special attention, which would've generated an increase in prescriptions. If this is the case, the cost of the dinners would unnecessarily increase the cost per prescription. Right. Did you all ever determine whether the dinners that you were taking the doctors on were helping sell OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    04:51:28    I don't remember  
Speaker 0    04:51:47    Over here.  
Speaker 2    04:51:56    And then let's mark this, uh,  
Speaker 0    04:52:00    28 28. Thank you for you.  
Speaker 2    04:52:13    And this says 6, 9 99, Dr. Richard Sackler subject promotion of OxyContin by Abbott. And if you go down to the bottom, it says in close for your information is a memorandum that mark Alfonso that describes a substantial increase in Abbott's field force allocation toward OxyContin, one 20 Abbott reps previously selling kinase, which has been temporarily withdrawn from the market will be assigned full time to OxyContin. This will be totally at Abbott's expense and should have a very positive effect on OxyContin sales. Um, that is from Michael Friedman, right? Correct. Um, what was the agreement reached with Abbott to sell  
Speaker 6    04:53:23    OxyContin? I don't recall the details of the  
Speaker 2    04:53:32    Agreement and then up at the top, it says sender Dr. Richard Sackler. So this would be, I think your, your reply to that. And it says, this sounds very good for the brand. I just hope that we can supply the surge that may follow this program. And were you referring to a surge of OxyContin cells?  
Speaker 6    04:53:54    Yes.  
Speaker 2    04:54:21    And was it your expectation that,  
Speaker 0    04:54:25    Uh,  
Speaker 2    04:54:28    Thank you. These sales representatives, uh, were going to create a surge in OxyContin sales?  
Speaker 6    04:54:35    I didn't know. I said let's hope.  
Speaker 2    04:55:04    And then this is a document, um, that I wanted to bring to your attention, cuz we were talking earlier than today where you said, you know, uh, when I was pointing out to you, the documents that, uh, from your, uh, officers that said OxyContin is believed by other physicians to be not as strong as morphine. Remember us having that discussion.  
Speaker 6    04:55:38    I recall.  
Speaker 2    04:55:38    Thank  
Speaker 0    04:55:39    You.  
Speaker 2    04:55:41    And this is a phase two OxyContin tablets team meeting June 13th, 1997. So this would be, um, well over a year after a year and a half after OxyContin has been launched and on the marketplace, correct?  
Speaker 6    04:56:04    Yes. About a year and a half, maybe a little less.  
Speaker 2    04:56:11    And S and if you could go to the, um, it says marketing and sales update. First paragraph Mike CU discussed in detail marketing's positioning of OxyContin. He explained we want to expand extensively in the non-cancer market segment while promoting OxyContin as the one to start with in cancer pain and the one to stay with through proper. And the next paragraph reads, we can show that we are as effective as morphine, but do not want to say OxyContin is as powerful as morphine. Uh, now did I read that correctly?  
Speaker 6    04:56:56    You read the words,  
Speaker 2    04:56:57    Words such as powerful may make some people think the drug is dangerous and should be reserved for the more severe pain,  
Speaker 3    04:57:04    If I can interject for a moment, sir, cuz while you are reading it correctly, what you haven't included is the fact that the word powerful in quotes.  
Speaker 2    04:57:14    Yes. Um, we'll read it again and include that we can sh second paragraph. We can show that we are effective in as morphine, but do not want to say OxyContin is as powerful as morphine words such as powerful may make some people think the drug is dangerous and should be reserved for the more severe pain. This could have a negative effect in the much larger non-cancer pain market. Mike reminded the team that we should keep this positioning in mind as we develop future marketing programs, symposia clinical study manuscripts, and any other items that discussed the use of OxyContin. Um, did I read that correctly?  
Speaker 6    04:58:10    Are you asking me? Yes. I believe you did.  
Speaker 2    04:58:13    All right. Were you aware that that your marketing and sales team were being careful not to, uh, and did not want to say that OxyContin is as powerful as morphine?  
Speaker 6    04:58:30    I don't recall if I was aware of this  
Speaker 2    04:58:33    And in effect it's twice as powerful as morphine, correct?  
Speaker 6    04:58:36    No, it's not. We've gone through this quite a few times and here powerful as in quotes, sometimes the words stronger, weaker, powerful, uh, are not in quotes, but here it is very clear that it was specifically the word powerful that he did not. He was advising people to stay away from, it had nothing to do with potency.  
Speaker 2    04:59:01    When you go in and see a doctor and you say, uh, if they say OxyContin is not as powerful as morphine, what do you think the doctor thinks  
Speaker 6    04:59:10    He was not supposed to say that? And I don't think he did say that that would create confusion. He was warning not to use the word powerful in any context, but it clearly didn't mean potency because potency was declared as twice as potent, as morphine from day one of marketing to yesterday and today in every piece of material in all the conversion charts and was recognized and understood by physicians  
Speaker 0    04:59:55    Documents  
Speaker 2    04:59:55    That he gave  
Speaker 0    04:59:57    Us earlier. Mitchell gave us,  
Speaker 2    05:00:14    Go ahead. We'll come back to that. What is this?  
Speaker 6    05:00:30    Take a break now  
Speaker 3    05:00:31    It's almost three 30. This be a good time to take a short break. It's  
Speaker 2    05:00:34    Be a great time.  
Speaker 0    05:00:35    So  
Speaker 1    05:00:36    We are off the record at 3:27 PM. We are back on the record at 3:42 PM.  
Speaker 2    05:00:48    Okay. Um, a while ago when we were talking about salespeople making calls, did I understand you to say that you did not believe the number of calls made by a salesperson affected the number of prescriptions for OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    05:01:05    I didn't mean to communicate that. Okay.  
Speaker 2    05:01:07    Thank you. Uh, in fact, Purdue had, uh, requirements on their salespeople that they had to make certain number of calls every day to physicians, correct.  
Speaker 6    05:01:17    There was a standard of number of calls. Yes.  
Speaker 2    05:01:24    And, uh, before we broke, we were discussing this, um, phase two OxyContin, uh, tablets team meeting. And to kind of put this in perspective, there was this email dated 6, 2 97. So that's June 2nd 97 that we were discussing earlier where we discussed that physicians did not think OxyContin was as strong as MS Contin and that perception was out there. And, uh, and, uh, noted that it was important to be careful not to change the perception by physicians toward oxycodone when developing promotional pieces. Um,  
Speaker 3    05:02:14    Mr. Thompson, you're referring to another document. Could you identify it and give it to the witness?  
Speaker 2    05:02:17    We've already talked about it earlier. I'm just asking a question right now.  
Speaker 3    05:02:20    Well, but you're asking a question based on the earlier document reading from the earlier  
Speaker 2    05:02:24    Document. I won't read from it then. Uh, let me ask you, do you recall us having that conversation?  
Speaker 6    05:02:31    I'm not sure which document I've seen a lot of documents, but I do recall having talking about this many times. Yes,  
Speaker 2    05:02:39    Yes. And, and your comment was, well, we're not saying that it's not as strong. We're saying it's not as effective. Um, uh, I'm sorry. I object to the form in that question, your comment was, we're not trying to convey that. Um, it's not as powerful, uh, is that correct?  
Speaker 6    05:03:04    No. Um, what I thought I communicated, perhaps I didn't do it well, was that the meaning of that word strong was not that it was a weak drug weaker than morphine. It was not that meaning it, the meaning related to the stigma of morphine and to the fear of morphine and precisely in this case, I believe that the efficacy of the drug and, and I really would like to see the document if I might, if we're gonna talk about it, because I'd like to refresh my memory, not only as to the document as to what I had meant to say, if I didn't say it clearly,  
Speaker 2    05:04:00    Here's the one we were talking about when we wrote,  
Speaker 6    05:04:06    What exhibit is that, sir? Is that 29?  
Speaker 2    05:04:09    It's on the bottom  
Speaker 6    05:04:10    29, 29.  
Speaker 0    05:04:11    Okay.  
Speaker 2    05:04:20    And they've actually used two words here that are in quotes, correct. One is effective and one is powerful. And the sentence reads, we can show that we are as effective as morphine, but we do not want to say OxyContin is as powerful as morphine. Did I read that correctly?  
Speaker 6    05:04:38    That's correct.  
Speaker 2    05:04:40    All the, have you reviewed the OxyContin abuse and diversion and efforts to address the problem that was put out in December, 2003 by the GAO?  
Speaker 6    05:05:04    No, I did not review that.  
Speaker 2    05:05:08    Give you a copy of that. You've never seen that document. Is that correct?  
Speaker 6    05:05:18    Do you wanna mark it as the exhibit?  
Speaker 2    05:05:20    Uh, I will, yes. Okay. But have you ever seen that document?  
Speaker 6    05:05:24    I don't recollect seeing that document  
Speaker 2    05:05:27    If you would turn to page nine and I'm looking at the second paragraph last two sentences in both 2001 and 2002 OxyContin sales exceeded 1 billion, 1 billion and prescriptions were over 7 million. The drug became Purdue main product accounting for 90% of the company's total prescription sales by 2001. Um, is that information correct?  
Speaker 6    05:06:08    To the best of my recollection, it's correct. Or almo very close to correct.  
Speaker 2    05:06:14    And if you'll turn to page 17, it under the heading Purdue focused on promoting OxyContin for treatment of non-cancer pain. And if you go down to the last sentence of the second paragraph, it says one of Purdue's goals was to identify primary care physicians who would expand the company's OxyContin prescribing base sales representatives were also directed to call on oncology nurses, consultant, pharmacists, hospices, hospitals, and nursing homes. And is that information accurate,  
Speaker 6    05:07:05    Sorry, as a general proposition? Yes. It doesn't include oncologists. I don't think in the spirit, I think it's accurate.  
Speaker 0    05:07:14    Okay.  
Speaker 2    05:07:15    And then down second sentence from the bottom, Purdue has stated that by 2003 primary care physicians had grown to constitute nearly half of all OxyContin prescribers based on data, data from IMS health and information service providing pharmaceutical market research. Is that information accurate?  
Speaker 6    05:07:37    I, I can't vouch for the accuracy of this.  
Speaker 2    05:07:57    The next sentence says Deas analysis of physicians, prescribing OxyContin found that the scope of medical specialties was wider for OxyContin than five other controlled release scheduled to narcotic animal DEA. And is that the drug enforcement agency?  
Speaker 6    05:08:16    I believe it would be  
Speaker 2    05:08:17    DEA expressed concern that this resulted in OxyContin being promoted to physicians who were not adequately trained in pain management. Uh, do you recall the DEA expressing that concern?  
Speaker 6    05:08:29    No.  
Speaker 2    05:08:35    Next two sentences produced promotion of OxyContin for the treatment of non-cancer pain contributed to a greater increase in prescriptions for non-cancer pain. Then for cancer pain from 1997 through 2002, according to IMS health data, the annual number of OxyContin prescriptions for non-cancer pain increased nearly tenfold from about 670,000 in 1997 to 6.2 million in 2002. Um, is that information accurate?  
Speaker 6    05:09:07    I, I don't know. Okay. I just don't have these numbers in my mind.  
Speaker 0    05:09:15    Okay.  
Speaker 2    05:09:17    If you'd go to page  
Speaker 0    05:09:17    22nd,  
Speaker 2    05:09:27    Uh, paragraph by more than doubling its total sales representatives, Purdue significantly increased the number of physicians to whom it was promoting OxyContin.  
Speaker 2    05:09:39    Uh, each Purdue sales representative had specific sales territory and is responsible for developing a list of about a hundred, five to 140 physicians to call on who already prescribe opioids or who or who are candidates for prescribing opioids. In 1996, the 300 plus Purdue sales representatives had a total physician call list of approximately 33,400 to 44,500 by 2000, the nearly 700 representatives had a total call list of approximately 70,500 to 94,000 physicians. Each Purdue sales representative is expected to make 35 physician calls per week, and typically calls on each physician every three to four weeks. Each hospital sales representatives is expected to make about 50 calls per week and typically calls on each facility every four weeks. Uh, was that to your knowledge, accurate information about how Purdue was, uh, marketing OxyContin through its sales force econ through its Salesforce?  
Speaker 6    05:10:44    Well, without quibbling, it isn't really, you're asking me to vouch for the accuracy of this. I, I just don't carry these numbers in my mind. Um, so I can't agree or decide. I just don't know. Uh, but this is a count of physicians and a description of the standards, uh, of calls, but, uh, I don't, but that's, that really doesn't describe how we were marketing it to use your question. So I'm not trying to quibble with you, sir, but, uh, I just don't know.  
Speaker 2    05:11:24    All right. And if you'll go down to the middle of that next paragraph, the total amount of Bo the amount of total bonuses that Purdue estimated were tied to OxyContin cells increased significantly from about 1 million in 1996, when OxyContin was first marketed to about 40 million in 2001, do you recall, uh, do you have any reason to, um, disagree with the 40 million number for bonuses paid out to your marketing salesman? In 2001?  
Speaker 6    05:11:56    I don't, I don't know the number, so I don't have any reason to disagree.  
Speaker 2    05:12:07    And then if you go to the next page, um, last paragraph, it says, according to Deas analysis of IMS health data, Purdue spent approximately six to 12 times more on promotional efforts during Oxycontin's first six years on the market than it had spent on its older product. MS. Contin during its first six years, or then had been spent by Janssen pharmaceutical or one of Oxycontin's drug, uh, competitors. Duragesic. Did you see  
Speaker 6    05:12:36    That? Yep. Yes I  
Speaker 2    05:12:38    Did. Is that  
Speaker 6    05:12:38    Accurate? I don't know. I have no reason to, to agree with it or disagree. I just don't know.  
Speaker 2    05:13:01    Do you believe Purdue marketing was overly aggressive?  
Speaker 6    05:13:06    No.  
Speaker 2    05:13:20    Um, <affirmative> yeah. Do you believe Purdue marketing was appropriate?  
Speaker 6    05:13:28    I believe so.  
Speaker 2    05:13:31    Um, it says here under on page 30 Oxycontin's wide availability may have increased opportunities for illicit use. Um,  
Speaker 6    05:13:41    I'm sorry, what page do you need for  
Speaker 2    05:13:43    Page 30?  
Speaker 6    05:13:45    Page 30? Yes. Three zero. Okay. Okay. And where should I look?  
Speaker 2    05:13:58    Um, last paragraph.  
Speaker 6    05:14:01    Okay.  
Speaker 2    05:14:02    Thank you. The large amount of OxyContin available in the marketplace may have increased opportunities for abuse and diversion, both DEA and Purdue have stated that an increase in a drugs availability in the marketplace may be a factor that attracts interest by those who abuse and divert drugs. OxyContin. Uh, if you go on down, um, OxyContin became the top selling name, brand narcotic pain reliever in 2001. Um, is that accurate?  
Speaker 6    05:14:32    I, I don't know, but I, I just don't know.  
Speaker 2    05:14:46    Yeah. So, um, let's mark that as exhibit 30 30. Have you ever seen an article called what happened to the poster children of OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    05:15:18    No. That doesn't sound familiar.  
Speaker 2    05:15:20    Nobody has ever provided that to you at Purdue Pharma.  
Speaker 6    05:15:25    When was it published?  
Speaker 2    05:15:28    September 8th, 2012?  
Speaker 6    05:15:32    No, I wouldn't necessarily have been provided to the board, but I don't. I really, I'm not familiar with it.  
Speaker 2    05:15:54    Do you recall a time when Purdue OxyContin was considered so successful that other companies were thinking about whether they could make their own version of OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    05:16:06    Just re just ask the question again so I can answer it.  
Speaker 2    05:16:10    Sure. Do you recall a period of time where OxyContin was considered so successful that other companies were considering making their own version of OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    05:16:23    Um, I can't say that they did it because it was so successful, but I do recall, uh, that I did hear that other companies were trying to copy OxyContin. Yes.  
Speaker 0    05:16:43    Thank.  
Speaker 2    05:17:01    So this is an email chain that was provided. Um, let's go ahead and mark that as 31. And, um, if you go to page two, it says subject press release or similar promotion author, Dr. Richard Sackler 8 23 96.  
Speaker 6    05:17:28    Just, just let me catch up with you. 8 23 90. Oh, the bottom of the page. Okay. I'm with you.  
Speaker 0    05:17:44    <affirmative>  
Speaker 2    05:17:46    And it says, um,  
Speaker 0    05:17:48    Um,  
Speaker 2    05:17:50    I think it is no worthy to release information on OxyContin tablets, its use and success in the market and the tremendous reception it received in Vancouver. Uh, we've basically, uh, the newsworthy occasion is that this product has achieved our first year sales projection, four months early. And that by the end of the year, we should have from 130,000 to 150,000 per salesman of sales, the objectives of this release would be stimulate interest in the us community, in the medical community of the us to recognize the tremendous success of OxyContin tablets clinically, and the ratification commercially, we want many more physicians than have presently used it to become aware of its availability and importance in their practice. It would be hope that this would lead to greater use by those currently prescribing and broaden our prescribing base in the us and Canada.  
Speaker 0    05:18:45    Um,  
Speaker 2    05:18:47    And, um, do you know whether that press release took place?  
Speaker 6    05:18:51    I don't know.  
Speaker 2    05:19:07    And then above that, it looks like there's a response to your email from Robert reader.  
Speaker 6    05:19:17    Yes.  
Speaker 2    05:19:18    Given the diverse, in both short and midterm goals, I would recommend a full flesh PR firm with a one to three year contract. That way this can be coordinated, actively to achieve all goals rather than a one shot flash. Is this a departure from traditional P slash P LP and that's Purdue Frederick slash Purdue Pharma LP strategy,  
Speaker 6    05:19:42    Right? Correct.  
Speaker 2    05:19:45    And you wrote back and said, I don't see this as a quote departure from policy. And then it looks like, and perhaps this is Friedman who says, my view is different. If you want to use PR to signal our market as to our development pipeline, I have no problem. I do not want to spend money on PR to increase sales. We do not need to have an agency in our pockets. I have learned my lessons. And then you write back on the page one and say, I agree about the agency. I want to signal the licensing in market for the product around the world, get an audience for our patent infringement suits so that we are feared as a tiger with claws, teeth, and balls, and build some excitement with prescribers. That OxyContin tablets is the way to go. And what was your concern there about, uh, licensing and patent infringement?  
Speaker 6    05:20:50    Well, licensing in market meant the, uh, get the attention of companies that had products that might be attractive for us to license.  
Speaker 2    05:21:14    Do you recall, um, Howard UDel making a trip down to Kentucky to meet with attorney general, Greg Stubo and other members of the,  
Speaker 0    05:21:27    Um,  
Speaker 2    05:21:29    Of his staff?  
Speaker 6    05:21:31    I don't recall it, no.  
Speaker 2    05:21:34    This is a letter dated May 17th, 2005. And that would be prior to the felony plea agreement that Purdue Frederick entered into. Correct.  
Speaker 6    05:21:48    I'm not, I think I'm clear on the dates and that, that would be correct, please. Correct. Somebody here, correct me if I'm wrong  
Speaker 2    05:22:03    And on you'll turn to page six, this is appears to be a letter from Howard UAL dated May 17th, 2005 to Greg, the attorney general of Kentucky. And he points out that, um, none of <affirmative>, none of the federal courts in Kentucky has found any misconduct on the part of Purdue, correct?  
Speaker 6    05:22:43    I'm I'm not sure. Just where you're reading.  
Speaker 2    05:22:45    I'm sorry. I'm on page five.  
Speaker 6    05:22:46    Oh, page five. I'm sorry. I was on the wrong page. And where are you reading from  
Speaker 2    05:23:00    The third paragraph down.  
Speaker 6    05:23:08    And it begins, I believe that even this brief,  
Speaker 2    05:23:12    No, it's, I'm reading middle of the paragraph significantly Howard, not one of these courts has found any misconduct on the part of Purdue.  
Speaker 6    05:23:20    Okay. Please bear with me while I try to find this.  
Speaker 2    05:23:44    You see that right above the case sites.  
Speaker 6    05:23:48    I'm sorry. Uh, uh, in the paragraph that has a list of cases.  
Speaker 2    05:23:52    Yes. Paragraph,  
Speaker 6    05:23:53    Right. So significantly. However, thank you.  
Speaker 2    05:23:56    Yeah. Purdue answered file an answer in all of these cases and claim they had never done anything improper or wrong. Isn't that true?  
Speaker 6    05:24:05    I don't know.  
Speaker 2    05:24:08    Are you aware prior to the,  
Speaker 6    05:24:10    That is, I don't know whether we filed in the, in all these cases or whatever. That's what I mean when I say, I don't know.  
Speaker 2    05:24:17    Are you aware of Purdue ever admitting to doing anything improper? Um, um, prior to the plea agreement where, um, the company pled guilty to a felony of misbranding a drug with the intent to defraud or mislead.  
Speaker 6    05:24:39    Okay. Just ask the question before the play mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    05:24:46    <affirmative>  
Speaker 6    05:24:47    Am I, what aware  
Speaker 2    05:24:48    Are you aware of anyone at Purdue ever admitting they did anything improper prior to entering into the plea agreement where the company pled guilty to miss branding a drug with the intent to defraud or mislead?  
Speaker 6    05:25:09    I am not aware of anybody.  
Speaker 2    05:25:16    And then if you go to page six, the middle of the second paragraph from the bottom, it says first, uh, any suit bought under the act requires proof that a defendant engaged in a practice of violation of KRS 360 7, 1 70, an insurmountable obstacle since Purdue has committed no unlawful act. Um, did I read that correctly?  
Speaker 6    05:25:51    You did.  
Speaker 2    05:25:52    And were you aware that Howard UDel had communicated with Greg stumble that Purdue had commuted, committed? No. Unlawful act on May 17th, 2005.  
Speaker 6    05:26:06    I think he was writing for Purdue Pharma just for clarity, but I was not aware of this.  
Speaker 0    05:26:13    Okay.  
Speaker 2    05:26:21    Yeah. From May 17th, 2005, did Purdue Frederick exist?  
Speaker 6    05:26:28    I don't know.  
Speaker 2    05:26:34    Do you know if the companies were merged at some point?  
Speaker 6    05:26:37    I don't believe they were.  
Speaker 2    05:26:44    Let's talk about the agreed statement of facts. Do we have another copy of this  
Speaker 8    05:27:01    Marks gonna  
Speaker 2    05:27:02    Mark the letter? Oh,  
Speaker 8    05:27:06    Might as well, quote the letter and the agreed statement. Facts.  
Speaker 2    05:27:09    Yeah. That's a good idea to  
Speaker 8    05:27:12    The letter's gonna be exhibit 30, 2 32. And the agreed statement. Facts is gonna be exhibit 33,  
Speaker 2    05:27:18    Hand this out by the letter.  
Speaker 8    05:27:20    You the, yeah, the, the May, 2005. Okay.  
Speaker 2    05:27:35    Who was in charge of preparing and approving the sales and marketing materials at the time of Oxycontin's release?  
Speaker 6    05:27:41    I'm sorry. At the time of Oxycontin's  
Speaker 2    05:27:44    Release  
Speaker 6    05:27:45    Release, meaning launch launch, Michael Friedman, I believe.  
Speaker 2    05:27:53    And at that time, at the time of the launch who was in charge of the marketing department  
Speaker 6    05:28:02    To the best of my recollection, mark Alfonso.  
Speaker 2    05:28:05    Okay. And Michael Friedman, was he the person who ultimately was appointed CEO of Purdue?  
Speaker 6    05:28:12    He was Purdue Pharma.  
Speaker 2    05:28:16    Is he one of the individuals who pled guilty to the misdemeanor at the time of the plea agreement?  
Speaker 6    05:28:22    Yes.  
Speaker 2    05:28:30    Do you recall whether Purdue had received warning letters about its marketing of Ms. Cotton?  
Speaker 6    05:28:37    I don't recall.  
Speaker 2    05:28:39    You don't recall six warning letters coming in from Ms. Cotton? Uh,  
Speaker 6    05:28:43    No, I don't. I don't recall the, the instances.  
Speaker 2    05:28:54    Do you recall Purdue getting warning letters with respect to the way it was marketing Ms. Uh, marketing OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    05:29:03    I don't recall.  
Speaker 2    05:29:05    Do you know if Purdue, um, consistently denied it was doing anything wrong with respect to marketing OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    05:29:17    I'm not sure. I, I would think that we denied, uh, doing anything wrong, but that's a guess on my part. I don't really know.  
Speaker 2    05:29:30    All right. The  
Speaker 6    05:29:31    Guilty don't recollect. Yeah.  
Speaker 2    05:29:42    Were you involved in approving the agreed statement of facts or the guilty plea?  
Speaker 6    05:29:50    The board voted in favor of management's recommendation that we have, that we plead guilty, uh, under a plea agreement with the us attorney.  
Speaker 2    05:30:05    And just so there's no confusion, the board, uh, and voted to adopt the agreed statement of facts. Um, is that correct?  
Speaker 6    05:30:20    I don't know. I don't remember,  
Speaker 2    05:30:30    Uh, is the agreed statement of facts accurate?  
Speaker 6    05:30:34    I believe it is.  
Speaker 2    05:30:45    And in addition to the guilty plea of a felony for, or misbranding a drug with the intent to defraud on mislead, uh, and that drug is OxyContin, correct?  
Speaker 6    05:31:04    I believe it is  
Speaker 2    05:31:06    These three individuals, Howard UDel, Michael Friedman, and Paul Goldenheim also pled guilty to misdemeanors, correct?  
Speaker 6    05:31:18    Yes.  
Speaker 2    05:31:19    And Howard UDel was produced executive vice president and chief legal officer.  
Speaker 6    05:31:26    He was  
Speaker 2    05:31:27    Michael Friedman was the president and CEO of Purdue at the time of the guilty plea.  
Speaker 6    05:31:33    I believe he  
Speaker 2    05:31:33    Was. And Paul Goldenheim was the former executive vice president for worldwide research and development in chief scientific officer, correct?  
Speaker 6    05:31:45    I believe so.  
Speaker 2    05:31:46    Uh, by 2006, Dr. Goldenheim had already left Purdue, correct? Yes. Did he leave voluntarily?  
Speaker 6    05:31:54    He did.  
Speaker 2    05:31:55    What reason did he provide you regarding why he was leaving Purdue?  
Speaker 6    05:31:59    He was leaving Purdue in order to be CEO of another company.  
Speaker 2    05:32:07    And have you seen this agreed statement of facts before,  
Speaker 6    05:32:11    Before today? Yes. Yes.  
Speaker 2    05:32:15    Uh, did you provide comments on this document?  
Speaker 6    05:32:18    No, I did not.  
Speaker 2    05:32:23    Were you surprised by any of the allegations in the document?  
Speaker 6    05:32:34    I don't. I didn't read the whole document. Um, so I can't say if there are allegations that would surprise me. I had understood that this was a settlement document and that people in the company who'd investigated, um, thorough <affirmative>, um, thoroughly said to the board that the statements in the document were true.  
Speaker 2    05:33:02    Okay. And when you say I didn't read the document, uh, as we sit here today, have you ever read the entire document?  
Speaker 6    05:33:09    No.  
Speaker 2    05:33:11    Um, at the time this was signed in, uh, May 7th and eighth of 2007. What was your position in the company?  
Speaker 6    05:33:25    I was a director of the company.  
Speaker 2    05:33:27    Did you have any other role at that time?  
Speaker 6    05:33:31    Not to my recollection for a period of time after I ceased to be CEO in early 2003, I was Cocha non-executive chairman of the board. Uh, but that came to an end more or less around this time, but I don't remember the, whether it was before the plea or after  
Speaker 2    05:33:54    You ceased to be CEO in 2003. Is that correct? That's correct. When were you first notified that the, uh, us attorneys for the Western district of Virginia were investigating Purdue?  
Speaker 6    05:34:07    I can't recall. Precisely. I, we were as a board notified that the us attorney was investigating OxyContin abuse and diversion, and that the law department in general and Howard UDel in particular were providing any documents. He wished, uh, voluntarily, um, to help his investigation, um, that the investigation turned on Purdue was a surprise. But I don't remember when that happened.  
Speaker 2    05:34:49    Was it before you left as CEO?  
Speaker 6    05:34:51    I don't recall.  
Speaker 2    05:34:53    Do you recall there being issues about, uh, addiction, dependency, uh, tolerance buildup, uh, abuse and diversion, uh, prior to your leaving the CEO?  
Speaker 6    05:35:09    Yes. Not all of those, but, uh, abuse and diversion. Yes.  
Speaker 2    05:35:17    Do you recall there being issues, uh, with addiction?  
Speaker 6    05:35:21    Yes. Same time as I was informed about a possible abuse and diversion.  
Speaker 2    05:35:28    And when were you first informed about possible abuse and diversion?  
Speaker 6    05:35:34    Sometime in 2000, um, an article was published in a newspaper in Maine that very graphically described, uh, the impact of abuse and diversion of individuals who were using OxyContin. That was the first, that was the first time I became aware of that possibility.  
Speaker 2    05:36:27    Okay. Let me see. Do you recall receiving a letter or being notified about a letter from a hospital in, um, Pikeville or hazard concerning, um, problems with patients who were on OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    05:36:57    I don't recall a letter. Was it directed to me?  
Speaker 2    05:37:02    I don't believe so. I think it came to Purdue. And I'm wondering if you saw it's, let's go back to the plea agreement. We'll try to get through this. Um, um, okay. Um, are you aware that we've requested Purdue to identify the names of documents referenced in the agreed statement of facts?  
Speaker 6    05:37:57    I'm not aware of that?  
Speaker 2    05:38:07    Um, are you aware, we've asked them to identify the individuals who are referenced in the agreed statement of facts?  
Speaker 6    05:38:13    No  
Speaker 2    05:38:29    Paragraph, if we can go to paragraph 13 of the agreed statement of paragraph 13 says that on December 28th, 2004, produced submitted an OxyContin NDA, the FDA, the NDA included clinical trials showing that OxyContin when dosed every 12 hours was as safe and as effective as immediate release oxycodone, dosed every 12 hours,  
Speaker 6    05:39:11    Every six  
Speaker 2    05:39:12    Hours. I mean, sorry, every six hours. Yes.  
Speaker 6    05:39:14    Yes. And  
Speaker 2    05:39:15    Then  
Speaker 6    05:39:15    That's what it says.  
Speaker 2    05:39:16    And then paragraph 14 says the NDA did not claim that OxyContin was safer or more effective than immediate release oxycodone or other pain medications. And Purdue did not have, and did not provide the FDA with any clinical studies demonstrating that OxyContin was less addictive, less subject to abuse and diversion, or less likely to cause tolerance and withdrawal than other pain medications. And is that paragraph correct?  
Speaker 6    05:39:43    That's what it says. I don't know if it's correct, but I wouldn't differ with it.  
Speaker 2    05:40:05    And then there are some medical officer reviews, correct?  
Speaker 6    05:40:11    Yeah. I believe those are within the FDA.  
Speaker 2    05:40:14    Right. And, uh, and those also did not state that OxyContin was more effective than, or superior to safer had less opioid effects or caused fewer adverse events than any other marketed product.  
Speaker 6    05:40:29    Correct? I believe that's true.  
Speaker 2    05:40:32    And, and me back up a minute, do you know what PHY, when salespeople go call on physicians, what type of information the physician usually asks the salesperson?  
Speaker 6    05:40:44    I would not be able to comment on that.  
Speaker 2    05:40:46    You don't know whether, uh, they want to know if there's any studies, if there's any contraindications to the medicine, any problems reported, have you  
Speaker 6    05:40:54    Encouraged? That makes sense. I thought you meant in more, that's very general thing. They wanna understand. What is the medicine for? What kind of condition who are the patients? What are the, what is the effectiveness they might ask for comparative effectiveness? I, if it exists and, and if it doesn't exist, the answer is we can't give you any, they might ask about safety. They might ask about anything related to, um, what they feel they should know when they were they to use the medicine.  
Speaker 2    05:41:35    One of the things they might ask is why is it better than what I'm already using? Why should I switch? Is that reasonable,  
Speaker 6    05:41:41    Perfectly reasonable?  
Speaker 2    05:41:42    One of the things they might ask is, you know, you got any studies that show it's better is another thing that comes  
Speaker 6    05:41:51    Up. They might  
Speaker 2    05:41:57    Paragraph 16 says, um, the medical officer review, sir, review of the ISS included these statements, um, and the blood level data and clinical use suggest the opioid effects would be of OxyContin, immediate release oxycodone would be similar. Um, and to your knowledge, is, is that clinically correct?  
Speaker 6    05:42:32    Well, it's an inference and I certainly can't differ with the inference, but it may not be correct.  
Speaker 2    05:42:51    Uh, under D it said withdrawal is possible in patients who have their dosage abruptly reduced or discontinued. Um, is that your understanding of the characteristic of a drug?  
Speaker 6    05:43:03    Absolutely.  
Speaker 2    05:43:11    And then it said care should be taken to limit competitive promotion. OxyContin has been shown to be as good as current therapy, but has not been shown to have a significant advantage beyond reduction in frequency of dosing. And, uh, is that your understanding of the characteristic of the drug?  
Speaker 6    05:43:29    No, it is my understanding that that statement is correct,  
Speaker 6    05:43:36    But the reason I said that that may not be the case was the very surprisingly large number of reports from the field that I heard. Second and third hand that early in the life of the product doctors spontaneously volunteered that the drug was better than we said it was. And this was so frequent and so unusual that it raised in my mind and continues to raise the question. Maybe it is actually superior, but we were never able to demonstrate using the methods that would be generally accepted that this was the case. It was an impression that doctors developed on their own.  
Speaker 2    05:44:38    Um, any studies, retrospective studies, anything of that nature that would support that statement?  
Speaker 6    05:44:45    No, I said we could never prove it.  
Speaker 2    05:44:50    So if you go on here under the heading misbranding of OxyContin, and, and when we talk about misbranding, that's just really making claims and statements that aren't true about a drug that's called misbranding the drug, is that correct?  
Speaker 6    05:45:08    No, I wouldn't say it's that. I would say it's got a, a different meaning, um, in the regulatory world, it's stating things that are not strictly in the package insert. Okay. They may be true, but if they're not in the package insert they're misbranding.  
Speaker 2    05:45:35    Um, yeah. Do you know if Purdue had information that physicians were concerned about the abuse potential for OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    05:45:48    I do not. Did not have that. It wouldn't surprise me that physicians would be concerned about that as with any other strong opioid or in fact, any other opioid,  
Speaker 2    05:46:03    Let me refer you to paragraph 20. Yeah, it says here beginning on or about December 12th, 1995. And continuing on, or about June 30th, 2001. And that is the timeframe that the us attorney's office looked into, um, the conduct at Purdue, correct.  
Speaker 6    05:46:34    I don't know,  
Speaker 2    05:46:37    Uh, right. Um, certain Purdue supervisors and employees with the intent to defraud or mislead, marketed, and promoted OxyContin as less addictive, less subject to abuse and diversion, and less likely to cause tolerance and withdrawal than other pain medications as follows under a, it says that you train Purdue sales representatives. Meaning when I say you mean Purdue, the company trained Purdue sales representatives and told some healthcare providers that it was more difficult to extract the oxycodone from an OxyContin tablet for the purpose of intravenous abuse. Although Purdue's own study showed that a drug abuser could extract approximately 68% of the oxycodone from a single 10 milligram milligram OxyContin tablet by crushing the tablet, stirring it in water and drawing the solution through cotton into a syringe. Were you aware that, uh, Purdue trained sales representatives to make that misrepresentation?  
Speaker 6    05:47:41    No.  
Speaker 2    05:47:43    Uh, is that a misrepresentation that would, um, cause a physician to be more likely to use, uh, to write prescriptions for OxyContin or less likely to write prescriptions for OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    05:47:57    I would, I, I couldn't guess the implication is that it would be more likely, but I don't know.  
Speaker 2    05:48:05    And then number B says, told Purdue sales representatives, they could tell healthcare providers that OxyContin potentially creates less chance for addiction than immediate release opioids. Um, were you aware that Purdue told sales representatives, they could tell healthcare providers that there was less chance for addiction with OxyContin than with immediate release opioids?  
Speaker 6    05:48:33    No, I was not aware of that.  
Speaker 2    05:48:38    And under C it says sponsored training that taught Purdue sales supervisors, that OxyContin had fewer peak and trough blood level effects than immediate release opioids resulting in less euphoria and less potential for abuse than short-acting opioids. Were you aware that they were teaching sales supervisors to make that, um, misleading? Um,  
Speaker 6    05:49:05    Absolutely not statement  
Speaker 2    05:49:09    Under D it says told healthcare providers that patients could stop therapy abruptly without experiencing withdrawal symptoms. And that patients who took OxyContin would not develop tolerance to the drug.  
Speaker 3    05:49:21    Uh, I object to the form of the question in reading D uh, you omitted the word certain, which appears before healthcare providers.  
Speaker 2    05:49:30    Oh, let me read it again. Under D Purdue told certain healthcare providers that patients could stop therapy abruptly without experiencing withdrawal symptoms. And that patients who took OxyContin would not develop tolerance to the drug. Were you aware that certain healthcare providers were being told that they could stop therapy abruptly without experiencing withdrawal symptoms? Uh, and that patients who took OxyContin would not develop tolerance to the drug?  
Speaker 6    05:50:00    No.  
Speaker 2    05:50:01    Okay. And that statement is false, correct?  
Speaker 6    05:50:04    It, no, it's, it's it, it's not clear to me it's false, but I am eager not to, to contend with it. Um, it says certain healthcare providers and it, the rest of it is conditioned really in large measure on, in the first case, the dose that the patient is on. And the second case in the duration that the patient is on, but reading between the lines as I suspect, um, those who shaped this did and understood, but the government, I can accept it as being a reasonable expression of, of improper conduct. That is certain healthcare providers might have been told regardless of dose or regardless of duration. But had I known about this, I would've alerted our attorneys were negotiating this, that, that this ought to be a little bit more specific because it's gonna be difficult to agree with it the way it's written, but I'm I'm will quibble with  
Speaker 2    05:51:26    It. Well, there was actually a whole lot of back and forth on this  
Speaker 6    05:51:29    Document. There may have been, but I wasn't with me.  
Speaker 2    05:51:33    And a lot of the things brought up the us attorney's office said, no, we're, we've reviewed the documents and we're not changing this stuff. Is that what happened?  
Speaker 6    05:51:42    I don't know.  
Speaker 3    05:51:43    Uh, just, just to be clear is the document we're reading the agreed statement of facts, uh, Purdue refers to the Purdue Frederick company, which is the practice we've had in this deposition from the outset that you've used Purdue to refer to Purdue Frederick.  
Speaker 2    05:51:58    Yes. Yes. Um, and because nobody at Purdue is able to say which employees were Purdue Frederick, and which employees were Purdue Pharma, as far as I've been able to ascertain in any of the depositions I've read so far, um, including one's taken in the past, but we'll cover that later. Um, U under E here, it says, um, that Purdue super certain Purdue supervisors and employees with the intent to defraud or mislead call told certain healthcare providers that OxyContin did not cause a buzz or euphoria caused less euphoria had less addiction, potential had less abuse. Potential was less likely to be diverted than immediate release opioids and could not be, and could be used to quote weed out addicts and drug seekers. And, uh, were you aware that those statements were being made to healthcare  
Speaker 6    05:53:00    Providers? No.  
Speaker 2    05:53:04    And then the next section is miss branding of OxyContin use of graph graphical depictions by sales representatives. And it says data from Purdue clinical studies was used to create the following graphical demonstration of the difference in the plasma levels at steady state, between patients who took OxyContin every 12 hours and patients who took immediate release OxyContin every six hours. Um, and it says that on October 12th, 1995, Purdue requested comments from the FDA's division of drug marketing, advertising communication about its proposed launch marketing materials, which included the following graft and tech showing oxycodone plasma concentration provided by OxyContin on a logarithmic scale, along with a statement that OxyContin oxycodone blood plasma levels provided fewer peaks and valleys than immediate release OxyContin,  
Speaker 6    05:54:12    Oxycodone,  
Speaker 2    05:54:13    Oxycodone, I'm sorry on paragraph says on December 20th of 95 after  
Speaker 6    05:54:21    We, oh, we're going, I'm sorry. Term page. Yes. Okay. Thank you.  
Speaker 2    05:54:26    On December 20th, 95, after reviewing the proposed OxyContin launch materials, DD M a C what is DD M a C  
Speaker 6    05:54:35    DD Mac. Uh, it's the division of the FDA. I don't know what the letter stand for, but it is the division of the FDA that reviews promotional materials and comments on their agreement, that they are, uh, reasonably reasonable and accurate and consistent with the package insert, or they differ with them and recommend changes or elimination of things,  
Speaker 2    05:55:06    And, you know, to sort of cut through it. What they did is they said, if you wish to compare blood levels in this text, uh, we suggest that the blood levels for both dosage forms be presented in the graphic so that the reader can accurately interpret this claim. They felt it was misleading the way it was correct.  
Speaker 6    05:55:25    No, I don't. I don't think so. I think they had a suggestion that we should add that, and I don't know why it wasn't there. Um, we certainly had the data as it's shown above.  
Speaker 2    05:55:36    Okay.  
Speaker 6    05:55:37    Um, so I assume we added the data  
Speaker 2    05:55:40    And then it says paragraph 24 on or about January 11th, 1996, Purdue told D D M a that it had quote, deleted the statement, fewer peaks and valleys than with immediate release oxycodone. And they took the statement out. Correct.  
Speaker 6    05:55:59    That's what it says. I don't know why it was true, but I, I, I have no knowledge of the dialogue between them or why they took it out.  
Speaker 2    05:56:13    Did, did you review any of the studies that were done? Um, I mean, actually get down and look at the data in the studies that were done prior to the launch.  
Speaker 6    05:56:21    I looked at the analysis of studies, but I didn't look at the data that is the individual case report  
Speaker 2    05:56:29    Forms. Okay. And as we sit here today, have you ever seen the data of the studies themselves?  
Speaker 6    05:56:36    No. That would be the luminous. And, uh, I don't, I don't think it would be necessary for a senior executive to do that because every study is subject to extremely rigorous, um, validation, uh, of the database with the paper record, the paper record that exists with the doctor's own records. And so, um, this approach, which has been standard in the industry, and I believe part of good laboratory practices are one of the other standards that the FDA has promulgated, uh, is extremely exhaustive, which is one of the reasons that studies take so long because the validation of the data can take anything from a month to a year.  
Speaker 2    05:57:31    Are, are you saying that your studies that you did before putting Purdue on the mark were extremely exhaustive?  
Speaker 6    05:57:39    They were certainly appropriate for a molecule that had been in use at that point 80 years or more, um, that was believed then to be safe and effective as a molecule. Um, and that had no at that time, no long term toxicities that hadn't been well developed. And so a lot of that information was brought into the package, insert whether we observed them in the trials or not. So the standards for this kind of an approval, which has its own designation are easier to meet. They're called 5 0 5 B2 NDA and draw upon in this case, a vast public literature, as I said, extended back 80 plus years. So for that, it was very extensive in those kind of applications.  
Speaker 2    05:58:48    But when you took a controversial opioid and expanded it to non-malignant pain, uh, at pills that contain high dosages of opiate, you didn't do any addiction studies before putting in on the market, correct  
Speaker 0    05:59:06    Object to the form of the question.  
Speaker 6    05:59:12    First of all, the compound oxycodone was mostly used in nonmalignant pain before we entered the market. That was where the market, the, the great bulk of the market existed. So there was no innovation or change in our bringing it to the nonmalignant pain market. Um, the second thing was that we didn't, we assumed that it was potentially addictive, that it could be subject to abuse and diversion, and the package insert then, and through many changes has not denied that in fact has called it out ex explicitly in several places, including right in the front of the label. When we said it was a class two narcotic, and every doctor knows that class two narcotics are among the most abusable products,  
Speaker 2    06:00:09    A class two narcotic that your own records show, uh, there was a belief among physicians that it wasn't as strong as morphine, correct?  
Speaker 6    06:00:18    No, that it wasn't stigmatized as morphine was. They knew it was, if you had asked them, is it more potent than morphine? Many physicians knew it was more potent. If they used both drugs, they knew that they would always start with a much lower dose of oxycodone than they would with morphine.  
Speaker 2    06:00:46    So you think physicians, most physicians knew it was more potent than morphine.  
Speaker 6    06:00:52    Yes. They also knew what doses to use it in.  
Speaker 0    06:01:09    We,  
Speaker 2    06:01:11    You just mark this as exhibit,  
Speaker 0    06:01:18    Is this 34? Yes.  
Speaker 2    06:01:21    Let me refer you to the first paragraph of this document dated January 26th, 2001. We're now five years after OxyContin has been on the market, correct.  
Speaker 6    06:01:36    Um, which part of this should I read from? Yes. The, the date is around five years from marketing  
Speaker 2    06:01:45    And it says up here, this is from mark Alfonso. Uh, the first paragraph says, I think it will, in the mind of the physicians, hydrocodone gives them a great degree of comfort. Physicians rank the drugs based on the position that they have created in their mind as a result of prescription  
Speaker 6    06:02:08    Prescribing,  
Speaker 2    06:02:08    Prescribing habit and promotion. Um, and promotion would be what marketing from Purdue Pharma?  
Speaker 6    06:02:17    No.  
Speaker 2    06:02:18    What, what do you think it means when it says  
Speaker 6    06:02:21    Promotion is the promotion of everybody in the industry from going back years and years.  
Speaker 2    06:02:29    Okay. It says for them morphine and hydromorphone are the most potent followed by oxycodone and then hydrocodone.  
Speaker 6    06:02:41    I see it.  
Speaker 2    06:02:42    Yeah. Were you aware that in January 25th, 2001, mark Alfonso, and what was his role at Purdue  
Speaker 6    06:02:48    Purdue? He was head of  
Speaker 2    06:02:49    Marketing. The head of marketing felt like physicians did not feel like oxycodone was as potent as morphine.  
Speaker 6    06:02:57    We've gone through this before. Um, it was, that was a term of that didn't refer to relative potency. It just didn't. Um, he didn't include fentanyl in this, which is the most potent, but is often used before hydrocodone or morphine.  
Speaker 2    06:03:22    Well, let, let me ask you this  
Speaker 6    06:03:23    So well, I'm just saying it just, I realize that you've changed the meaning that was intended and understood  
Speaker 2    06:03:32    By the no let's his word? Potent, not mine.  
Speaker 6    06:03:34    No, no, no. You've changed the meaning of the word. Potent. Not the word, the meaning of the  
Speaker 2    06:03:39    Word. I didn't change it. It's it's  
Speaker 6    06:03:41    His word? No, no. You've changed it when you try to use it as though it means relative potency,  
Speaker 2    06:03:48    Right? When we first discussed the first group of documents, you said, no, they're just talking about effectiveness, not strength. The second group of documents where they said it's stronger than morphine, you said no, they just mean strong in a general sense. They don't mean potent here. They use the word potent. I mean, do you just not think physicians don't think it's as strong as morphine? Cause that's, that's what they keep saying. They don't want to clear up in the physician's mind that it's as strong as morphine.  
Speaker 6    06:04:17    It, this is a hierarchy here. Okay. Okay.  
Speaker 2    06:04:23    Well, we  
Speaker 6    06:04:24    Here, mark Alfonso said here, talking that if following your reasoning, if your reasoning were correct, that physicians would see morphine as the most potent of all these drugs, it was the for them morphine and then hydrocodone and in most places, oxycodone and then hydrocodone, the facts are that hydromorphone is three to eight times more potent than morphine, but that isn't how he listed it. And hydrocodone and oxycodone are close to equal potent, but that he didn't say potent. He said powerful and powerful in this case has to do with the hierarchy that they place drugs. Morphine was the last, because it was the most stigmatized.  
Speaker 2    06:05:17    So when he says here, remember that we tried to reposition OxyContin as powerful as morphine. And we could not finally, we decided not to mess with this perception since it was helping us in the non-cancer market. Did you see where he wrote that?  
Speaker 6    06:05:33    I see where he wrote it.  
Speaker 2    06:05:35    All right. Let's go back to the plea agreement. Oh,  
Speaker 15    06:05:42    How do we need to mark that back?  
Speaker 2    06:05:44    It's marked  
Speaker 3    06:05:45    Number 34,  
Speaker 2    06:05:48    Paragraph 25 of the agreed statement of facts says on or about December, 1998, Purdue sponsored training for all its district sales managers. Um, now it wasn't some of 'em it's all of them, correct?  
Speaker 6    06:06:05    It says all  
Speaker 2    06:06:06    During this meeting a pharmacist retained by Purdue. Do you know who that pharmacist was?  
Speaker 6    06:06:12    No.  
Speaker 2    06:06:13    Um, a Pharma pharmacist retained by Purdue to conduct a portion of the training used the following graphical demonstration parenthesis. Instead of the graphical demonstration of the actual clinical data described in paragraph 21 of this agreed statement of facts and falsely stated that OxyContin had significantly fewer peak and trough blood level effects than immediate release opioids resulting in less EU fear, euphoria, and less potential for abuse than short acting opioids. And they've got a graph that was used at the training for the  
Speaker 6    06:06:50    Purdue. I wouldn't, I would call that a cartoon. Yeah. Not a graph.  
Speaker 2    06:06:54    And it says on paragraph 26 beginning in or around 1999, some of Purdue new sales representatives, those would be Purdue Pharma sales representatives in 1999. Correct?  
Speaker 6    06:07:08    I can't say I  
Speaker 3    06:07:09    Object to the question. Purdue was defined in this document as, as Purdue  
Speaker 2    06:07:13    Frederick. Yeah. But it says new sales representatives. So are we talking about Purdue Pharma or Purdue  
Speaker 6    06:07:18    Frick? I just don't know  
Speaker 3    06:07:19    The doc the document on its face is talking only about Purdue Frederick.  
Speaker 2    06:07:23    Yeah. The guy that helped put the document together, the lawyer we took his deposition. Have you seen his deposition?  
Speaker 3    06:07:31    I've seen his deposition.  
Speaker 2    06:07:32    Yeah. And he says, he doesn't know if they're Purdue Pharma or Purdue when he refers to this, I'm telling you  
Speaker 3    06:07:38    This document on its face, this fines Purdue is Purdue Frederick. I don't care what anyone else said.  
Speaker 2    06:07:43    Sure. And I'm asking him if it's correct. And he's saying you don't know, correct?  
Speaker 6    06:07:50    No, let's go. I said, I don't know who employed these new representatives.  
Speaker 2    06:07:56    Okay. Um, it says some Purdue new sales representatives were permitted during training at Purdue headquarters to draw their own blood level graphs to falsely represent that OxyContin, unlike immediate release or short-acting opioids did not swing up and down between euphoria and pain and resulted in less abuse potential. And were you aware that the sales reps were doing that?  
Speaker 6    06:08:20    No.  
Speaker 2    06:08:26    And then it says during the period, 1999 through June 30th, 2001, Purdue reps used graphical depictions, similar to the one described in paragraph 25 of these grid statement and, uh, agreed statement of facts and falsely stated to some healthcare providers that OxyContin had less euphoric effect and less abuse potential than shorting opioid opioids. Were you aware that they had no engaged in that conduct?  
Speaker 6    06:08:51    No. I'm sorry.  
Speaker 2    06:08:55    And then to go on with the conduct, paragraph 28 says, uh, misbranding of OxyContin misleading use of article to claim, no withdrawal or tolerance and it proceeds to discuss, um, how Purdue,  
Speaker 0    06:09:15    Um,  
Speaker 2    06:09:19    Well, let's go ahead and read it. Um, uh, had an, I'll try to shorten this a little bit for Purdue had an osteoarthritis study. Um,  
Speaker 6    06:09:33    It's okay. You don't have to rush.  
Speaker 2    06:09:34    Yeah. Are you familiar with that?  
Speaker 6    06:09:37    May I read it? If you don't want to read it into the record, can I just read it and then respond?  
Speaker 2    06:09:47    I'll tell you what it'll save time. I'll read it into the record. Okay. On or about January 16th, 1997, certain Purdue supervisors and employees sent to the FDA, the results of a clinical study pertaining to the use of low doses of OxyContin by osteoarthritis patients. Um, it's call it the osteoarthritis study and a final report that included in a section pertaining to respite periods. The statement parenthesis, no investigator reported withdrawal syndrome as an adverse experience during the respite periods in a section entitled adverse experiences by body system, during respite periods, the report's summary of the major results listed the most frequently reported adverse experiences in respite periods to be nervousness, insomnia, nausea, pain, anxiety, depression, and diarrhea followed by the statement 28 patients, 26% had symptoms recorded during one or more respite periods. Did I read that correctly?  
Speaker 6    06:10:54    I think so. I was kind of reading ahead of you.  
Speaker 2    06:11:00    And then it says paragraph 29 on or about may 20 se uh, May, 1997, certain Purdue supervisors and employees stated that while they were well aware of the incorrect view held by many physicians that oxycodone was weaker than morphine. They did not want to do anything to make physicians think that oxycodone was stronger or equal to morphine or to take any steps in the form of an emotional materials, symposia, clinicals, publications, conventions, or communications with the field force that would affect the unique position that OxyContin had in many physicians' mind, uh, in quote. And did I read that correctly?  
Speaker 6    06:11:44    You read the words correctly  
Speaker 2    06:11:45    And was that part of the agreed statement of facts  
Speaker 6    06:11:47    It is.  
Speaker 2    06:11:51    And then it goes on to say on or about February 12th, 1997, certain supervisors and employees of a United Kingdom company affiliated with Purdue provided certain Purdue supervisors and employees with an analysis of the osteoarthritis study together with another clinical study. This analysis included a list of eight patients in the osteoarthritis study and 11 patients in the other study who had symptoms recorded that may possibly have been related to opioid withdrawal, including one patient in the other study who required treatment for withdrawal symptoms syndrome. Did you ever review that study?  
Speaker 6    06:12:30    No.  
Speaker 2    06:12:41    Um, the discussion section of this analysis include the following quote. It's not surprising that some patients in the clinical trials develop some degree of physical dependence and consequently experience withdrawal symptoms as a result of abrupt discontinuation of OxyContin tablets, all patients who respected to have withdrawal symptoms have been reported, but this may have resulted in a falsely high incidence of the patients who participated in the osteoarthritis study in which patients entered respite periods without OxyContin tablets, many symptoms suspected to be due to opioid withdrawal may simply have resulted from the return of pain after withdrawal of OxyContin tablets, uh, patient 6 0 0 7 complained of nervousness patient 2 0 4 complained of insomnia and felt restless patient 2 22, 28 were restless in anxious. Since these are symptoms, which often accompany the return of significant pain. It may be wrong to label these as withdrawal symptoms. Nonetheless, the instance of withdrawal syndromes in patients three with OxyContin tablets is a concern and it is safer to over report than under report. This problem, this analysis conclusions included this statement as expected. Some patients did become physically dependent on OxyContin tablets, but this is not expected to be a clinical problem. So as long, so long as abrupt withdrawal of the drug is avoided.  
Speaker 0    06:14:09    Um,  
Speaker 2    06:14:11    Were you aware that certain Purdue employees participating in the final draft of the article regarding the osteoarthritis study that was published in a medical journal on or about March 27th, 2000. Um, okay. Um, were you aware they participated in that publishing of that study?  
Speaker 6    06:14:30    No.  
Speaker 2    06:14:34    The results section of the article, uh, I'm reading from paragraph 31, right. Included the following three statements pertaining to the incidence of withdrawal syndrome and withdrawal symptoms experienced by study patients. One patient was hospitalized parenthesis for withdrawal symptoms. The patient who was hospitalized with withdrawal symptoms had completed the study on a previous day and had been, been receiving CR oxycodone 70 milligram symptoms resolved after three days. Um, <affirmative> um, a second patient received 60 milligrams CR oxycodone experienced withdrawal symptoms after running out study medication, the patient had not reported withdrawal symptoms during scheduled respite from doses of 30 or 40 withdrawal symptom was not reported as an adverse event for any patient during scheduled respite, adverse experiences reported by more than 10% of patients during scheduled respite were nervousness nine patients with insomnia, eight patients, um, purple paragraph 32 says the article included a comment section, uh, summarized, um, the three statements and the results and further suggested that patients taking low doses could have their OxyContin treatment abruptly discontinued without experiencing withdrawal if their condition so warranted. Were you aware they were making that claim?  
Speaker 6    06:16:23    No.  
Speaker 2    06:16:25    If you go over to paragraph 34, it says on or about June 26th, 2000 certain Purdue supervisors, employees sent the full text of this osteoarthritis study article. Do you know which supervisors and employees sent the full text of this article?  
Speaker 6    06:16:42    No.  
Speaker 2    06:16:43    Do you know if it was the marketing group?  
Speaker 6    06:16:45    I don't know.  
Speaker 2    06:16:47    And it says, um, together with a marketing tip to produce entire Salesforce, the marketing tip stated that a reprint of the osteoarthritis study article was available for use in achieving sales success. The marketing tip also included as one of the articles, 12, 12 key points. There were two reports of withdrawal symptoms after patients abruptly stopped taking CR oxycodone at doses of 60 or 70 withdrawal syndrome was not reported as an adverse event during scheduled respite, indicating that CR oxycodone at doses below 60 milligrams can be discontinued without tapering the dose. If the patient conditions sow warrants, it says on or about February 13th, 2001, certain Purdue supervisors and employees received a review of the accuracy of the withdrawal data in the osteoarthritis study and stated, now this is Purdue's own people reviewing this data, correct.  
Speaker 6    06:17:52    That's how I would  
Speaker 2    06:17:53    Read it. And it says, quote, upon a review of all comments for the enrolled patients. It was noted that multiple had comments which directly stated or implied that an adverse experience was due to possible withdrawal symptoms. This was followed by a list of 11 study patients who reported adverse experience due to possible withdrawal symptoms. During these periods, 106 patients initially participated in the osteoarthritis study, 32 of them withdrew because of severe, I'm sorry, because of adverse events, not necessarily related to withdrawal and 38 patients remaining in the study at 12 months. Um, and then the next paragraph reads on or about March 28th, 2001. So this is a month and a half later a Purdue employee emailed a Purdue supervisor regarding the review of the withdrawal data described in paragraph 35 of the agreed statement of facts asking, do you think the withdrawal data from the osteoarthritis study is worth writing up parenthesis and abstract, or would this add to the current negative press that should be deferred? The supervisor responded? I would not write it up at this point and no abstract was prepared. Do you see that?  
Speaker 6    06:19:11    I see  
Speaker 2    06:19:11    It. So am I correct that Purdue was using the marketing material from this article, um, improperly and not reporting the adverse effects, uh, and was allowing their sales force to use it. I object to the form of the question.  
Speaker 6    06:19:30    Let's break that into one question at a time, please.  
Speaker 2    06:19:33    Sure. Was Purdue's marketing department using this article.  
Speaker 6    06:19:38    That's what it says here.  
Speaker 2    06:19:40    And were they using it, uh, inappropriately?  
Speaker 6    06:19:44    That's what it says here.  
Speaker 2    06:19:48    And when somebody pointed out that the withdrawal data from the arthritis study was actually different than how the sales force was using it and asked, should we write it up or is this going to add to the current negative press and should be deferred? The person supervisor said, I would not write it up at this point. Correct.  
Speaker 6    06:20:09    That's what it says.  
Speaker 2    06:20:10    Do you know if it ever got written up? I don't know. Do you know if any of these doctors that were shown this were ever told that, uh, that it actually wasn't correct?  
Speaker 6    06:20:18    I don't know.  
Speaker 2    06:20:21    Do you know if anybody at Purdue made an effort to go tell these doctors that all of these marketing things that had been brought up in the agreed statement of facts, um, uh, were not correct?  
Speaker 6    06:20:33    I don't know.  
Speaker 2    06:20:35    Did you yourself ever tell anybody to go inform doctors that these marketing, um, statements that had been used by Purdue employees that were not accurate, um,  
Speaker 0    06:20:51    Um,  
Speaker 2    06:20:51    Were, um, were in fact not accurate,  
Speaker 6    06:20:54    I was not aware of this story or the study or the marketing materials or statements.  
Speaker 2    06:21:04    And as the director of Purdue Pharma, you were not made aware of any of this.  
Speaker 0    06:21:13    I object to the form of the question. You can answer  
Speaker 6    06:21:15    Operator. I do not recall whether we were, you're talking about at the time of this document being written. Yes, I don't recall.  
Speaker 2    06:21:30    And at the time that this, uh, conduct went on from 96 to 2001, the time period investigated by at least this us attorney under this agreed statement of facts, you were in fact, the CEO of Purdue Pharma,  
Speaker 6    06:21:47    Correct? During 2000, very, very late 99 until early 2003. I was the CEO. Yes.  
Speaker 2    06:22:02    And so if this conduct occurred, um, on May 18th, 2000, June 22nd, 2000, February 13th, 2000. And on March 18th, 2001, this employee was told not to write up the withdrawal data because of negative press and that it should be deferred. You'd have been the CEO during this time period, correct?  
Speaker 6    06:22:28    Yes. Okay. What was Robert in 99 until this?  
Speaker 2    06:22:37    Yeah. What, what was Robert reader's role at Purdue?  
Speaker 6    06:22:40    He was a senior medical officer.  
Speaker 2    06:22:52    Next paragraph says, uh, so between June 26th, 2000 and June 30th, 2001, certain Purdue supervisors and employees distributed copies of the reprint of the osteoarthritis study article to all of Purdue sales representatives for use in the promotion and marketing of OxyContin to healthcare providers, including the distribution of 10,615 copies to certain Purdue sales representatives between February 13th, 2001 and June 30th, 2001. Um, so it looks like on March 28th, the supervisor tells the employee don't write up the withdrawal data from the osteoarthritis study. Uh, it would add to the current, uh, negative press and should be deferred. And between February 13th, 2001 and June 30th, 2001, 10,615 copies of, uh, the osteoarthritis study were distributed to sales representatives. Correct.  
Speaker 6    06:24:14    That's what it says. It says certain Purdue  
Speaker 0    06:24:16    Sales represents,  
Speaker 2    06:24:18    Um, was the purpose of submitting it to the sales representative so they could show it to the physicians that they called on.  
Speaker 6    06:24:28    I don't know,  
Speaker 2    06:24:30    There's only, uh, 800 sales reps at Purdue that produced highest volume of sales reps during this period of time. Correct,  
Speaker 6    06:24:45    To the best of my recollection. That's approximately true.  
Speaker 2    06:24:48    So if you wanted to give a copy to each sales rep for their own use, you'd probably only need 800, but they printed off 10,615 copies, correct?  
Speaker 6    06:24:57    Distributed. Yes.  
Speaker 2    06:25:03    Is it reasonable to conclude that the sales reps were showing these to the doctors  
Speaker 6    06:25:09    It's reasonable to conclude that some sales reps may have shown them to doctors yes. To some doctors.  
Speaker 2    06:25:18    Do you know if Purdue ever got any of this 10,000 16, 615 copies of the osteoarthritis article? Uh, back,  
Speaker 6    06:25:34    I don't know if this, when this was found and I don't know when this was found by sales or marketing management or medical department, it would've been the practice to recover them. Yes, but I don't know if it was found and I don't know if it was done.  
Speaker 2    06:26:00    Um,  
Speaker 6    06:26:00    This all came to light in 2006 or seven. So I don't know it could have been long past, but I don't know.  
Speaker 2    06:26:09    It says, um, on paragraph 38 during the period, June 26th, 2000 through June 30th, 2001, certain Purdue sales representatives distributed the reprint of the osteoarthritis article to some healthcare providers and falsely, or misleadingly stated that patients taking OxyContin doses below 60 milligrams per day can always be discontinued abruptly without withdrawal symptoms. And that patients on such doses would not develop tolerance. And that's not an accurate statement, is it?  
Speaker 6    06:26:43    I don't believe so.  
Speaker 2    06:26:45    And then on, um, with regard to misbranding of OxyContin use of reduced abuse, liability claims in marketing, um, it says paragraph that's OxyContin package insert approved the FDA stated by the FDA stated delayed absorption as provided by OxyContin tablets is believed to reduce the abuse liability of the drug that's called the reduced abuse liability statement. Certain Purdue supervisors, employees instructed Purdue sales representatives to use this statement to market and promote OxyContin. Paragraph 40 says certain Purdue sales reps while promoting and marketing OxyContin, falsely told some healthcare providers that the reduced use liability statement meant that OxyContin did not cause a buzz or euphoria cause less euphoria had less addiction. Potential had less abuse. Potential was less likely to be diverted than immediate release opioids and could be used to weed out addicts and drug seekers. And, um, it says by March, 2000 various Purdue supervisors and employees in different parts of the company had received reports of OxyContin abuse and diversion occurring in different communities. And that on or about November 27th, 2000 certain Purdue supervisor and employees amended the reduced abuse liability statement to say that delayed absorption as provided by OxyContin tablets when used properly for the management of pain is believed to reduce the abuse liability of the drug and instructed produce sales reps to use the amended statement to promote and market OxyContin. Uh, do you know why that statement was changed?  
Speaker 6    06:29:07    I'm not sure. No, I don't. And I'm not certain where it was changed in the package insert. I don't know if it was in the package insert then that had to be submitted to the FDA and to get approval, uh, in advance of using it. But I just don't know what this refers to.  
Speaker 2    06:29:42    Well, when Purdue found out that OxyContin was being abused and diverted, uh <affirmative> they changed their packet, insert kind of cleverly, really, if you read it right. Uh, when used properly for the management of pain, do you know what they meant by that?  
Speaker 6    06:30:08    I don't know what the people who wrote it meant by that or what the FDA understood cuz I was not involved in rewriting it.  
Speaker 2    06:30:17    Okay. Next paragraph says from March, 2000 through June 30th, 2001, certain produced sales representatives while promoting and marketing OxyContin, falsely told some healthcare providers that they reduced abuse liability statement. And the amended statement meant that OxyContin did not cause a buzz or euphoria caused less euphoria had less addiction, potential had less abuse. Potential was less likely to be diverted than immediate release opioids and can be used to weed out a and drug seekers. And those statements are not correct.  
Speaker 6    06:30:50    No, they're not correct.  
Speaker 2    06:30:53    Introduction of misbranded, uh, OxyContin into interstate commerce. And that is actually the, uh, the guilty plea. Pardon? Um, let's it's um, points out that, uh, Purdue manufactured and sold OxyContin in interstate commerce from various locations.  
Speaker 6    06:31:15    Are you reading? I'm just, yeah. Sorry to interrupt you, sir. Just tell me which number I should be following.  
Speaker 2    06:31:21    That's the very next paragraph,  
Speaker 6    06:31:22    Which is 44. Yes.  
Speaker 2    06:31:25    And that's just pointing out that Purdue sold OxyContin all over the us. Correct.  
Speaker 6    06:31:30    Let me read it and I'll tell you if I agree.  
Speaker 0    06:31:36    Yeah. Uh,  
Speaker 3    06:31:37    That's not what it says. I don't, I don't if, if you're reading from 44.  
Speaker 2    06:31:44    Yeah, you're right.  
Speaker 0    06:31:45    I  
Speaker 2    06:31:52    I'll withdraw the question. Okay. Did Purdue Pharma sell OxyContin all over the us  
Speaker 6    06:32:03    During what time period?  
Speaker 2    06:32:07    Um, 1996 to 2001.  
Speaker 6    06:32:11    Yes.  
Speaker 2    06:32:19    Now as part of the reason Purdue was able to get away with making these misrepresentations is because Purdue was aware that physicians did not understand the complex processes of treating pain.  
Speaker 6    06:32:32    I don't think so.  
Speaker 3    06:32:33    I object to the form of the question. It's argumentative.  
Speaker 6    06:32:41    Should I answer it? Sure. You can answer it. I don't don't think so.  
Speaker 2    06:32:48    Um, did Purdue own focus groups show that doctors uh, didn't understand, um, whether OxyContin was stronger than morphine?  
Speaker 6    06:33:11    I don't know.  
Speaker 2    06:33:21    What about the treatment of pain? Did you feel like doctors understood or physicians understood, uh, prescribing practices that should be utilized for the treatment of pain?  
Speaker 6    06:33:34    You'd have to put a timeframe to that or, or ask the question with more color, um, and more details.  
Speaker 0    06:33:47    Okay.  
Speaker 2    06:33:48    Um, in that the reason y'all were claiming that you needed to spend so much money educating physicians is cause they didn't understand pain prescribing.  
Speaker 6    06:33:58    Some physicians learned how to prescribe for pain from materials that we produced or information that sales reps gave them. Others knew how to treat pain and, um, they would be more interested in trying this agent, uh, in comparison to how they were treating pain. Before, when we entered the pain market in 1985 in the us, there was almost, it was abysmal in a sense, not ignorance so much as ignoring pain in patients. Um, doctors just didn't want to deal with it and uh, left patients, uh, inadequately treated.  
Speaker 2    06:35:00    Um, would you agree that the only way to get a large sales force to use a marketing message is to instruct them explicitly and unmistakably to do so?  
Speaker 6    06:35:12    I don't understand the question.  
Speaker 2    06:35:15    Mr. Shapiro has testified. I want you to assume he's testified that the only way to get a large sales force to use a marketing message is to instruct them explicitly and unmistakably to do so. Would you agree with that?  
Speaker 6    06:35:27    I, I really don't understand it  
Speaker 3    06:35:31    Once again, if you're reading from a transcript, please show  
Speaker 2    06:35:33    It to me. I'm I'm I want you to assume he's testified to that,  
Speaker 6    06:35:37    But I don't underst I don't understand  
Speaker 3    06:35:39    When you have a transcript  
Speaker 2    06:35:40    In front of you. I don't have a transcript in front of me. I'm asking you from my own memory. Well, you  
Speaker 6    06:35:45    Oh, okay. I, I don't understand. I don't understand that statement. So I really can't agree or disagree with it.  
Speaker 2    06:36:01    Um, do you believe there's evidence of improper training that has occurred at Purdue based on the agreed statement of facts?  
Speaker 6    06:36:09    I would have to review it. It's my recollection. As you read, as we read through it was that one or two things involved in proper training, but I can't affirm that until I reread it.  
Speaker 2    06:36:25    Did you ever, um, do you know, as we sit here today, what percentage of your sales force was using this, these improper statements, uh, to educate physicians about prescribing OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    06:36:40    No, I don't know.  
Speaker 2    06:36:41    Okay. Whether it was a hundred percent, 50%, 10%, you don't have any,  
Speaker 6    06:36:46    I had no idea.  
Speaker 2    06:36:48    Do you know if anybody at Purdue tried to find out how many of their sales force had given physicians improper and incorrect information?  
Speaker 6    06:36:59    I know as I said before that from 2000, sometime in 2000, as we became convinced that there was a problem, many efforts were launched to train retrain, uh, and to determine, uh, whether sales reps were following company policy. And that effort goes on to this day. We, we put in place, for example, a whole compliance department in 2003 or 2004 with many employees who reported independently to the board and have continued to report independently to the board, um, to, in a sense back up the sales department and marketing department's own efforts to assure, uh, proper training and compliance with training. Um, but I don't know of any attempt to measure, uh, who said what and how many times, uh, when people were properly trained and, and they deviated from that, or went beyond that, uh, they were sanctioned and many of them were dismissed. We also had a whole downsizing in the field force from about 2000 3 0 4 until about 2007 or eight. Um, in which the 800 eventually went down to something like 200. Um, so, uh, I don't think there are too many survivors from this period, um, because they were selectively weeded out. Um, because on average three quarters of them would've been gone. Um, but I don't, I can't answer the, I know of any attempt to assess blame in that sense or to count.  
Speaker 2    06:39:16    Yeah. And that's not really my question. My question is did anybody at Purdue Pharma attempt to go back and find out which reps specifically had made comments to physicians that were improper or misleading about the attributes, uh, of OxyContin  
Speaker 6    06:39:39    And the answer is, I don't know.  
Speaker 2    06:39:42    Okay. Would you agree that giving, making the statements, uh, the improper statements that are referred to in the agreed statement of facts could compromise patient care?  
Speaker 6    06:39:58    Some of them yes. In some patients, obviously not all patients, but in some patients, some of the statements could compromise care. I would like to say suboptimize care, but,  
Speaker 2    06:40:28    And if I understand correctly, you have not reviewed any of the call notes that were pulled by Mr. Shapiro when he was doing his that's correct investigation.  
Speaker 6    06:40:38    As far as I know, I didn't, I was shown a few call notes. I didn't ask were these shown to Mr. Shapiro,  
Speaker 2    06:40:46    Was there a recommendation made by somebody right about that same time that the call notes system be changed  
Speaker 6    06:40:55    At about what time?  
Speaker 2    06:40:56    About the same time he was doing his investigation and reviewing the call notes?  
Speaker 6    06:41:01    I believe it was.  
Speaker 2    06:41:02    Yeah. And, uh, do the call notes, not contain as much information as they used to, uh, back in 2000  
Speaker 6    06:41:10    That I don't know, but the biggest change was to make the first and second line supervisors audit a substantial percentage of the call notes in their span of control.  
Speaker 2    06:41:28    If the call notes have less information in them, is it more difficult to audit them?  
Speaker 6    06:41:34    I would. I, I couldn't possibly guess. I don't know what they were before or after. They were very sketchy notes. The ones I saw, I must say they were selected and shown to me, but the ones I saw were in some cases almost indeterminate, you could not know what was happening.  
Speaker 2    06:42:00    How many did you see?  
Speaker 6    06:42:03    Six, eight, no more. I think probably fewer than, than six or eight, but I'll say six.  
Speaker 2    06:42:11    And who were those who showed those to you?  
Speaker 6    06:42:14    I was shown during the preparation for the deposition. I'd never seen them before.  
Speaker 0    06:42:19    Okay.  
Speaker 2    06:42:20    Um, you were the call notes, you were shown call notes from Kentucky reps, or  
Speaker 6    06:42:37    My recollection is somewhere.  
Speaker 2    06:42:54    Did you hire anybody or ask anybody to review Mr. She Shapiro's investigation for accuracy?  
Speaker 6    06:43:03    I did not ask that his investigation be audited for accuracy. Uh, there were many people in the law department, none of the compliance department who may well have done. So, but I don't know.  
Speaker 2    06:43:20    And would you expect if we did our own investigation, we would have essentially about the same number of improper call notes that he found.  
Speaker 0    06:43:29    That would be my expectation  
Speaker 2    06:43:57    At Purdue article second court, 2001,  
Speaker 0    06:44:08    Take a break. Sure. That's fine.  
Speaker 1    06:44:11    We are off the record at 5:26 PM. We are on the record at 5:55 PM.  
Speaker 0    06:44:28    Um,  
Speaker 2    06:44:40    No, I'm gonna pick up some more different, so let me show you, um, email, we've got a page two of this email. This is, um, from Jim Speed dated Tuesday, November 30th. Let's mark this as what exhibit dated November  
Speaker 2    06:45:21    During physician calls. This issue is a topic of hot discussion between me and the physician. While many salespeople have sold controlled release opioids as having less abuse potential. The current situation has placed us in an awkward situation. I feel like we have a credibility issue with our product. Many physicians now think OxyContin is obviously the street drug. All, uh, the drug addicts are seeking issues like purposely crushing the 40 milligram and 80 milligram tabs to quote get high, have been expressed. I have heard from physicians that pharmacists and pharmacists that on the streets, people are finding ways to extract the oxycodone from the tablet and are using a cotton ball to filter the talk talk as they draw it up in a syringe for quote, mainlining and quote. Um, were you aware that that was a concern in November of 1999?  
Speaker 0    06:46:20    No.  
Speaker 2    06:46:21    When did you first become aware, uh, that OxyContin was being diverted or abused  
Speaker 6    06:46:27    In the winter? Best of my recollection, winter of 2000, that is early in the year 2000.  
Speaker 2    06:46:42    Who has Dr. J David haddock?  
Speaker 6    06:46:44    Dr. Haddocks is a, both a dentist and an MD. He's an expert in both analgesic pain use of analgesics and pain management in general. And also, uh, I think is a recognized expert on addiction and treatment of addiction.  
Speaker 2    06:47:07    Did he work for Purdue Pharma?  
Speaker 6    06:47:10    He did.  
Speaker 2    06:47:12    Um, and what about Rena Goldman and Wendell Fisher? What were their jobs?  
Speaker 6    06:47:19    Rena Goldman, I don't know. And Wendell <affirmative> and Wendell Fisher, uh, was a sales manager, but I don't recall how high up he was in sales management. He was a, I think he was a regional manager at that point.  
Speaker 2    06:47:37    And what about Jim Speed?  
Speaker 6    06:47:40    I, I, the name, but I don't, I can't tell you what his position was. He was a field sales person. I don't know whether he was a manager or not, whether he was a district manager or a salesman.  
Speaker 2    06:47:53    Is it true that Wendell, uh, Fisher Fisher was a regional manager with oversights for the districts and territories located in Kentucky?  
Speaker 6    06:48:03    I don't know.  
Speaker 2    06:48:20    Um, is it true that OxyContin, uh, does produce a buzz or euphoria? Just like, uh, the controlled release, just like the immediate release  
Speaker 6    06:48:33    When used in pain patients? Yes. Or when abused,  
Speaker 2    06:48:37    When used in pain patients?  
Speaker 6    06:48:39    Uh, I don't, I can't tell you the percentages. I'm sure there are some people who might say that they feel a sense of euphoria. I, I, I really don't know what buzz means when people say they have a buzz, I, I, I'm not familiar, but there may be a brief period of time in which they feel some euphoria or sensation,  
Speaker 2    06:49:04    Whether you feel a buzz or euphoria does that have to do with how quickly the drug works?  
Speaker 6    06:49:10    Not so well, that's an element, but it has to do also with the dose and also with the patient's, uh, familiarity, if they've been on the same dose for a while, uh, I would think it's far less likely. And then there's in individual patient variation finally.  
Speaker 2    06:49:31    And, um, with respect to peaks and valleys, um, do the peaks and valleys that are referred to in all the marketing materials or a number of the marketing materials, um, does that have to do with whether somebody, uh, experiences a euphoria from taking OxyContin,  
Speaker 6    06:49:50    The, if they have any psyche, psychological experience, like euphoria, it's most likely to be at the peak blood level. So the fewer, the peaks, the fewer, the periods of euphoria, but I'm just generalizing. I'm not telling you that we've ever measured that  
Speaker 2    06:50:16    When did you first become aware that Purdue had marketed and promoted OxyContin as having less abuse potential?  
Speaker 6    06:50:24    Not until the investigations were done. Um, and I can't tell you which investigation or when, uh, but I certainly, uh, didn't know that people were saying that until I was told, uh, by management that they had done investigation and found that some people had said that,  
Speaker 2    06:50:56    Let me, let me ask you about, uh, patients who, um, have not had a prior incidence of addiction or abuse, but just, uh, someone who's put on OxyContin, uh, and has never had, uh, an opioid in the past. Do you know if they're put on a 20 milligram dose of OxyContin twice a day, how long they would have to take it before developing dependency?  
Speaker 6    06:51:27    I, I can give you a guess, but I don't know. It would, there's enormous individual variation here. So you can't say with any one person or predict that this person will develop dependency or this per, that person, won't at 40 milligrams a day. I assume that's the presumptive daily dose. You're you're asking me about,  
Speaker 2    06:51:52    Yes. Do you know if Purdue ever conducted any studies to determine how long a non-malignant pain patient who's never had an opioid before would have to be on the drug before they developed dependency or addiction?  
Speaker 6    06:52:12    I'm not aware of those studies being conducted?  
Speaker 2    06:52:41    Uh, is it fair to say that if Purdue wanted to do, uh, a study to make that determination, uh, that could be done  
Speaker 6    06:52:54    Dependency that is physiologic dependence, I think would be an achievable study that could be done. Addiction remains to be seen. A lot of people would say, it's almost impossible to do that, but the Purdue and other industry partners are just on the, on the cusp of trying to do that with a number of studies.  
Speaker 2    06:53:24    Could you do a retrospective study or could you have done a retrospective study if you had wanted to look at patients?  
Speaker 6    06:53:36    I would've to think about whether I could figure out a retrospective study. It would, it would be an interest. It's an interesting question, but I don't know the answer to it.  
Speaker 2    06:53:55    And what was Robert reader's role?  
Speaker 6    06:53:58    Robert was a senior medical scientist in the medical department.  
Speaker 2    06:54:05    And I want you to assume he's testified that Purdue lacked any evidence that OxyContin had a lower abuse potential. Uh, if that's true, if he testified to that, assuming he testified to that, would you agree with that statement or disagree?  
Speaker 6    06:54:20    Uh, if you could just repeat the statement so that I can concentrate on it.  
Speaker 2    06:54:28    Yeah. That he testified Purdue, like any evidence that OxyContin had a lower abuse potential.  
Speaker 3    06:54:34    Yeah. I, I object to the question. It's a very odd hypothetical question.  
Speaker 6    06:54:46    I don't know of any study that was done, but I don't know that no study was done. I just can't. I can't tell you for sure.  
Speaker 2    06:54:56    All right.  
Speaker 6    06:55:03    You're referring that to Purdue Frederick and you're referring to the timeframe up to the 2007 or 2010.  
Speaker 2    06:55:12    Yes.  
Speaker 6    06:55:13    Uh, okay. I just wanted to, I don't know my answer's the same, but I just wanted to be sure that my answer formed  
Speaker 2    06:55:21    Has, has Purdue Pharma done a study since then  
Speaker 6    06:55:26    We've done studies on Abu usability of many formulations, uh, and that we did them in the course of trying to develop, uh, and then select amongst several formulations. Uh, these were studies that were pioneered by Purdue with outside investigators and they attempted to, and I think quite would be considered today state of the art, um, to discern how easily practice drug abusers might be able to, uh, defeat the delivery system and, and abuse it.  
Speaker 2    06:56:18    Have you ever seen the deposition of Curtis Wright in the Poston case  
Speaker 6    06:56:23    In the  
Speaker 2    06:56:23    Poston P O S T O N?  
Speaker 6    06:56:26    No. I have not.  
Speaker 2    06:56:32    Did you ever discuss with Curtis Wright, whether, um, studies could have been done on the abuse potential of OxyContin prior to the release of OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    06:56:44    No.  
Speaker 2    06:56:45    If he testified those studies were possible and could have been performed prior to the release of OxyContin, would it surprise you?  
Speaker 6    06:56:59    I would have to know more before I've registered surprise or not. I'd have to know what he meant, what kind of studies and, and so on, perhaps he said we could have attempted to do it. That would surprise me less than if he said absolutely it could have been done. I, I just have to know what he's talking about.  
Speaker 2    06:58:04    I'm not sure what you're talking about.  
Speaker 0    06:58:08    <affirmative>  
Speaker 2    06:58:10    Um, this, uh, let hand you this email, sorry about this way there, this is an email here to be Richard Sackler on 8 27 97 to Craig, a McMan in Utah. Um, that's a doctor, is that right?  
Speaker 6    06:58:48    Name's not familiar instantly familiar to me.  
Speaker 2    06:58:51    If you'll go to the, why don't we mark, this did already  
Speaker 6    06:58:55    36 36.  
Speaker 2    06:58:57    If you go to the bottom, um, of the, of the second paragraph you, you write to him, um, I am drawing your attention to our newest product, OxyContin tablets, controlled release, oxycodone HCI, and have included some literature most important to your practice. Time of onset of OxyContin is as rapid as immediate release oxycodone, but duration is a full 12 hours and the patient reaches full blood levels in just two doses one day. Uh, was it your belief that the time of onset of OxyContin was as rapid as immediate release oxycodone?  
Speaker 6    06:59:45    That was what our data showed more or what almost as immediate, I believe, uh, in the study that I was referencing, but didn't reference in the note. I think it was 41 minutes for immediate release and 45 minutes or something like that for OxyContin. Um, now I recognize who he is  
Speaker 2    07:00:22    And who is he?  
Speaker 6    07:00:23    Uh, he was, uh, a doctor who a friend in Utah, um, was using and he must, it looks like he may have asked through his friend for me to send him some betaine. He was a DPN doctor of pediatric medicine, and they do a lot of surgery and betaine, um, is a necessary part of any surgical procedure. At least it's an antiseptic. An antiseptics is a necessary part.  
Speaker 0    07:00:56    Okay,  
Speaker 2    07:00:57    Let me give you a copy of this. And this is, um, if we can mark this as exhibit 37, this is an email dated May 15th, 1996. Looks like it was received by P Goldenheim MD. And, uh, he does work for Purdue Pharma, correct?  
Speaker 6    07:01:37    Yes, he was.  
Speaker 2    07:01:39    And it looks like, uh, you were also included by fax Dr. Richard Richard  
Speaker 6    07:01:44    Sackler. That's what it  
Speaker 2    07:01:53    Says. And if you go to the third page, it says professor dare did not see any major problems regarding registration of OxyContin in Switzerland. Some specific points need to be clarified parenthesis, monitored release approval. As for DHC, prince may be a possibility in prince. He considers the following subjects as important and would need further investigations. And the first paragraph says information about the abuse addiction potential versus other opioids because of the rapid onset of action of OxyContin. Did I read that correctly? You did. Did, uh, do you know if you, uh, obtained approval to sell OxyContin in Switzerland?  
Speaker 6    07:02:46    I believe we did.  
Speaker 2    07:02:47    And did you provide him with, uh, the information about the abuse addiction potential versus other opioids? Uh, because of the rapid onset act of action of OxyContin that he requested?  
Speaker 6    07:03:00    Um, I, I'm not clear that he was actually requesting it just saying that he was his opinion, it was necessary for registration. Uh, but I don't know whether anything was produced. I doubt anything was produced here that was not produced for the FDA or the other European agencies who approved OxyContin, if anything was produced, that was different. That is additional studies. They would've also gone to the FDA.  
Speaker 2    07:03:37    Do you know why he was concerned about the rapid onset of action of OxyContin? Um, with respect to abuse and addiction?  
Speaker 6    07:03:47    I don't know.  
Speaker 2    07:04:02    Um, with respect to the claims about peaks and valleys, did you ever review the information to see what peaks and valleys were present in the plasma blood levels with respect to  
Speaker 6    07:04:16    OxyContin in the five month? Did you say  
Speaker 2    07:04:20    No. Did you ever review  
Speaker 6    07:04:22    I'm sorry. My hearing is not correct. Yeah.  
Speaker 2    07:04:23    That's okay. I said with respect to, um, peaks and valleys, uh, the claim that there are peak valleys are different. Did you ever review the literature? Uh, regarding that  
Speaker 6    07:04:40    I was familiar with some studies, uh, that demonstrated that, uh, it was to some extent, an obvious characteristic is characteristic it, since the drug was taken twice a day, you'd have two peaks. Whereas the immediate release was taken four to six times a day. And so you'd have four to peaks.  
Speaker 2    07:05:06    Do you know if the level of peaks and troughs are similar or different?  
Speaker 6    07:05:11    My recollection is that they are about the same, but that's a fuzzy recollection and I would need to see the data to refresh myself and be sure, but I, I think you, my recollection is they were, they were close.  
Speaker 2    07:05:30    Do you know whether the controlled release, because it maintained a higher level and didn't have as much trough, um, during the day would be more likely to cause addiction or less likely to cause addiction?  
Speaker 6    07:05:42    I, my impression is that the average blood level was the same and I'm not certain. So your question is given that the average blood level is the same if I'm correct. And that's a recollection, I haven't Stu seen that data for a very long time. Um, the only diff the difference in the blood level, the remarkable difference would be half as many or a third, as many peaks and valleys. And, um, to the extent that somebody was seeking the drug or enjoying that element of the drug, the, the peak effect, I would think that the drug would be less attractive, but it's a conjecture, it's not knowledge because I don't think we ever did a study that I'm aware  
Speaker 2    07:06:48    Of. My, my question is if somebody has a controlled release and maintains a higher level, uh, uh, during the day with respect to valleys, uh, they don't have as many valleys. Does that cause is that more likely to make them become addicted or less likely? Do you know?  
Speaker 6    07:07:07    I don't think the valley, the valleys were about the too, so I, I don't think that the valleys or the height of the peak would've been any difference, the principle difference, I think would've been, um, and you saying addicted, would've been, um, fewer peaks and all of this presumes that they were using the drugs as they were made and presented,  
Speaker 2    07:07:39    And if they use it as made and presented, they would also, uh, be taking drugs for breakthrough pain, potentially. Correct.  
Speaker 6    07:07:49    They might well be, have gotten two prescriptions from a physician,  
Speaker 2    07:07:54    Right? If they, if, you know, the, the studies show that it lasts from eight to 12 hours, um, and if it lasts eight or nine hours in a patient and doesn't last till 12, uh, he may need an additional prescription rescue, uh, prescription for that also correct.  
Speaker 6    07:08:17    Possibly I would have told the physician, use the rescue, compute the daily dose and try giving that dose as OxyContin twice a day. That is half of that dose twice a day.  
Speaker 2    07:08:34    Do do you know, uh, was, was there any study done to determine whether patients who were given, uh, controlled release oxycodone an then had to take another one because it didn't last 12 hours, we're more likely to develop addiction, uh, or less likely to develop addiction.  
Speaker 6    07:08:53    I know of no such study and I don't recollect that anybody ever suggested such a study or such a hypothesis I would've had, I would've asked them. Why do you think that they are more prone or less prone to addiction? I wouldn't think it would make a difference again, not based on a study, but based on a conjecture. So I really would have to understand what is the reasoning, why, why taking the drug three times a day would be more likely to cause addiction or less likely.  
Speaker 0    07:09:44    All right.  
Speaker 2    07:09:49    Can we go off the record one second? Sure. Yeah, we are off the record  
Speaker 1    07:09:53    At 6:20 PM. We are back on the record at 6:33 PM.  
Speaker 2    07:10:00    Um, <affirmative> um, what I'd like to do is have you sift through these documents and with the exception of the GAO report, are all of these documents that are kept in the ordinary course of business at Purdue?  
Speaker 6    07:10:19    No, they would not all have been kept, uh, to my knowledge in the ordinary course of business. Um, we would've had some sort of destruction policy, but we have been engaged in litigation for so long and so many different matters that basically at least my documents I have, I don't think anything has been thrown away.  
Speaker 2    07:10:48    Are these all documents that were generated in the ordinary course of business at Purdue  
Speaker 6    07:10:54    Or at, at, at Purdue Frederick or in other companies or some of the overseas country companies? Yes. Sure.  
Speaker 2    07:11:02    Purdue Pharma, um, and Monday Pharma,  
Speaker 6    07:11:06    Purdue, Pharma, Pharma, Purdue, Frederick, whatever  
Speaker 0    07:11:15    Business records  
Speaker 2    07:11:21    Then are all of these business records.  
Speaker 6    07:11:25    I don't know that, you know, I'm not a lawyer. I  
Speaker 0    07:11:27    Think that's asking for a legal conclusion.  
Speaker 2    07:11:32    I'm not sure it is. Can you answer the question?  
Speaker 6    07:11:37    Okay. Are they business records? I, I really don't understand what that term means. I, it's not a term I've ever used, so they are what they are. I mean,  
Speaker 2    07:12:23    Um, I asked you about the OxyContin 20 milligrams prescription to your knowledge, was anything done to determine, um, how many people put on 40 milligram, 80 milligram or 160 milligram prescriptions would become addicted or dependent if they took it for a certain period of time?  
Speaker 6    07:12:55    No  
Speaker 2    07:13:01    Sitting here today. Um, after all, you've come to learn as a witness. Do you believe Purdue conduct in marketing and promoting OxyContin in Kentucky caused any of the prescription drug addiction problems now plaguing the Commonwealth?  
Speaker 6    07:13:19    I don't believe so.  
Speaker 2    07:13:21    Sitting here today after all you've come to learn is witnessed. Do you believe that produced con in Kentucky has led to an excessive or unnecessary amount of opioids being located throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky?  
Speaker 6    07:13:34    I don't believe so.  
Speaker 2    07:13:39    Do you believe that any of produced conduct has led to an increase in people being addicted in the Commonwealth of Kentucky?  
Speaker 6    07:13:49    No.  
Speaker 2    07:13:51    Do you agree that education information presented by a drug company to physicians needs to be fair and balanced?  
Speaker 6    07:13:59    Yes.  
Speaker 2    07:14:00    And do you agree if a company learns a physician does not understand a drug that is being sold by the company that they have a responsibility to educate them properly about the drug?  
Speaker 6    07:14:13    Yes.  
Speaker 2    07:14:15    Do you think Purdue has an obligation to provide physicians with truthful information?  
Speaker 6    07:14:21    Yes.  
Speaker 2    07:14:22    Do you believe Purdue provided any of the physicians in Kentucky with information that was not truthful?  
Speaker 6    07:14:29    No. I don't believe that.  
Speaker 2    07:14:30    Okay. And is that because you don't believe any of the sales reps engaged in the, in the, uh, conduct that is any of the sales reps in Kentucky engaged in the conduct that is described in the felony plea agreement?  
Speaker 6    07:14:47    That's my belief. I don't have any facts to inform me otherwise.  
Speaker 2    07:14:54    And you never checked, did you,  
Speaker 6    07:14:58    I don't know how I would have checked that.  
Speaker 2    07:15:03    Could you have looked at the call notes from your sales people in Kentucky to see what they were telling physicians and whether it was the same information referenced in the felony plea agreement?  
Speaker 6    07:15:15    I could have looked at the call notes, but I believe that all the call notes were reviewed at least once and probably multiple times by many people.  
Speaker 2    07:15:28    And why do you have that belief?  
Speaker 6    07:15:30    Because I know the number of investigations and the extensive training and retraining that was done, and I believe it would have surfaced any evidence of wrongdoing and been actionable. But as I, I said, I've only seen a few call notes and the ones I've seen are so cryptic and imprecise and unclear in their references, often you don't even know who's saying what these were memory joggers that I've seen. They were written by a person who had a conversation who wanted to recall that conversation two, four, six weeks later.  
Speaker 2    07:16:18    And when the call notes say, I told the doctor about less abuse, or I told the doctor, the drug had less euphoria or emphasized that that would be improper, correct?  
Speaker 6    07:16:30    If such call notes existed and they were that explicit. Yes. I didn't see any like that.  
Speaker 2    07:16:51    Did it ever occur to you to check and see whether the, the people you hired and paid 50 million for, to do a presentation and defend Purdue in the us attorney's office in the Western district of Virginia gave accurate and truthful information to the us attorneys regarding the call notes?  
Speaker 3    07:17:18    Well, I object to the four of the question. You can answer  
Speaker 6    07:17:22    It wouldn't occur to me that any attorney that we hired would give false information to any other attorney and much less so to the us attorney and his deputies.  
Speaker 2    07:17:39    When Dylan, I call notes, sir, when doing a call note search, did you ever find out how they went about it?  
Speaker 6    07:17:44    I'm sorry.  
Speaker 2    07:17:45    When, when the people you hired did their call note search. Did you ever find out how they went about it  
Speaker 6    07:17:52    At the time? It was described in fair, fairly explicitly. Um, but that was years and years ago. That was almost 15 years ago.  
Speaker 3    07:18:07    I, I think any further questions along this line were really impinged on privilege. So I object  
Speaker 2    07:18:27    Was a breakdown of the results ever provided to you  
Speaker 6    07:18:33    A in a way. Yes.  
Speaker 2    07:18:37    When you say in a way, how was it provided? Well,  
Speaker 6    07:18:40    I was told that,  
Speaker 3    07:18:42    Let me interrupt. I'm sorry. I think your questions are really leading the witness into attorney, client communications, and I would direct them not to not to respond to those questions.  
Speaker 2    07:18:58    Well, certify the question and we'll talk to the judge about it. I think I'm entitled to go into it if a judge says no, then, then of course we can't. That's  
Speaker 0    07:19:11    Fine. Um, uh,  
Speaker 2    07:19:20    So here's, um, um, a call on a mark Dubrick um, in Lexington, Kentucky from a K period boils. Do you know who that is?  
Speaker 6    07:19:36    I don't know either of those people.  
Speaker 2    07:19:39    Okay. Under a notes memo, it says, got to convince him to counsel patients that they won't get buzz as they will with short acting. Now, with that be an appropriate thing to do. Counsel, the doctor that the patients, uh, tell the doctor, convince the doctor to counsel patients, that they won't get buzz as they will with short acting.  
Speaker 0    07:20:02    Again, if you're reading from a document, please show it to the witness. Copy.  
Speaker 2    07:20:12    That's this is the only copy.  
Speaker 6    07:20:15    This is pretty easy to read. This is not small. So could you repeat the  
Speaker 2    07:20:38    Question? Yes. Would it be inappropriate to counsel the doctor to convince the doctor, to counsel his patients, that they would get less buzz with OxyContin versus?  
Speaker 6    07:20:48    Well, what it says here is that they won't get a buzz. And I don't think that telling a patient, I don't think you'll get a buzz is harmful because if they do, I would think that the patient would report it and he would know, oh no. Oh, um, I don't know why he would've told this to a patient, but I, I think that it actually could be helpful because many patients won't get a buzz. And if he would like to know if they do, he might have had a good medical reason for wanting to know that.  
Speaker 2    07:21:43    Um, do you know whether telling patients they won't, uh, telling doctors, patients won't get a buzz, uh, was one of the things prohibited by the, um, in the statement, agreed statement of facts in the felony, please.  
Speaker 6    07:21:59    Yes, but that, isn't what it says. He said we don't know what the conversation was between the doctor and the rep. But as I testified just a minute ago, I could see that this could have been not only, not harmless, but helpful.  
Speaker 2    07:22:22    Uh here's one  
Speaker 3    07:22:23    Actually. Are you gonna mark that as an exhibit?  
Speaker 2    07:22:25    No. I'm just gonna ask him about these here is one. Um,  
Speaker 3    07:22:29    Well the only difficult that you're asking questions about them, then we go forward from here, have no record of what it is he was looking at.  
Speaker 2    07:22:36    Well, this is my only copy. That's why I don't want, um,  
Speaker 6    07:22:39    You can  
Speaker 3    07:22:40    Keep it. Why don't you mark it as an exhibit? Don't give me a  
Speaker 2    07:22:42    Copy. If you wanna mark it later, you can, but I'm gonna ask him my questions right now so I can get outta here. I,  
Speaker 3    07:22:48    I object to this line  
Speaker 2    07:22:49    Of questions. You can object. I don't have to mark it if I don't want here's Ellen Ballard in Louisville, Kentucky sales rep, mark Kern. Do you know who that is?  
Speaker 6    07:22:58    No.  
Speaker 2    07:22:59    And in here it says, talked of less euphoria and more Conval with Oxy. Would it be inappropriate to tell patients they get less euphoria with Oxy?  
Speaker 6    07:23:39    We really don't know what was said. As I said, this is a memory jogger. He might have said there may be less euphoria or some people have less euphoria, or we, we just don't know what was said here. Okay. If all he said was, um, there may be less euphoria. That that could be true. And I don't see the harm. If you promised less euphoria, it shouldn't have been said  
Speaker 2    07:24:13    An agreed statement of facts. Doesn't say you have to promise less euphoria. It says if you mention to a doctor or infer that it causes less euphoria, that's improper. Correct?  
Speaker 6    07:24:25    That was what we agreed to. Yes, but this was 1998 long before there was an agreed statement of facts.  
Speaker 2    07:24:34    What difference does that make, if it's improper in 2007, wouldn't it be improper in 1998?  
Speaker 6    07:24:40    Not necessarily.  
Speaker 2    07:24:44    Well, the, the improper conduct that the agreed statement of facts, uh, the time period was 1996 to 2001, correct? Yes. And if this is 1998, it's within that time period, correct?  
Speaker 6    07:24:58    Yes.  
Speaker 2    07:24:58    Okay. Um, so by what kind of twisted logic are you saying that saying this in 1998, wouldn't be improperly cause the, because the agreed statement of facts is in 2007,  
Speaker 3    07:25:12    I object to the form of the question that it, isn't a question that's argumentative and it's really uncalled for,  
Speaker 2    07:25:19    If you can answer, go ahead.  
Speaker 6    07:25:22    I think I should stand on what I said.  
Speaker 2    07:25:26    Well, let me ask you this. Tell me all the basis you have for believing that, saying this in 1998, talk of less euphoria. Um, with Oxy, he, uh, would somehow not be a problem because the agreed statement was in 2007.  
Speaker 6    07:25:44    I don't know what he said in 1998. I know what he wrote, but I don't have quotes on it. I don't have a dialogue. I wasn't present. I don't know what he said. And I don't even know whether this was a document upon which the agreed statement of facts was constructed for all. I know this document was tossed away as inexact or in.  
Speaker 2    07:26:13    Let me ask you about this document. James Donley is the doctor at the Trover clinic in Madisonville, Kentucky, who was called on by Holly will. And the notes memo says quick, reminded him that Oxy gives flat blood levels. So less buzzed than Lortab. Is that the type of statement that's prohibited by the agreed statement of facts?  
Speaker 6    07:26:44    I don't know that. That's what she said. If you are asking me a hypothetical, I would say that this is not neither accurate nor appropriate. It doesn't actually give flat blood levels, as you know, and as our rep knew, and as any doctor who had been properly presented to the product would know, but nevertheless, even though it is demonstrably wrong, it, it would be still, uh, inappropriate to save on two bases on the basis of the agreed statement of facts and also on the basis it's untrue. But again, I have to emphasize, these are not transcripts. These are about as distant from transcripts as anybody can get. This is a memory jogger. And I don't know what she said. And I find it hard to believe that she said anything like this. This was to remind her of a discussion.  
Speaker 2    07:28:02    Have you ever spoken to her?  
Speaker 6    07:28:03    No.  
Speaker 2    07:28:04    Okay. Uh, this is Dr. David Parks in bowling green, Kentucky, who was called on by Philip Gross love the idea of giving effective pain relief, but not euphoria to get rid of druggie. If it was discussed with him that it gives effective pain relief, but not euphoria. And he loved the idea. Would that be inappropriate comments to make  
Speaker 6    07:28:29    Yes. If our rep made it, if the doctor made it, I don't think that that it's, it may be erroneous, but it isn't improper. And I don't know who made the statement.  
Speaker 2    07:28:48    Okay. Um, if the re  
Speaker 6    07:28:51    In fact, even what statement was made, I have not, I don't remember seeing any of these notes by the way, but these are typical. They are fragments of fragments, of fragments, of a conversation that are designed to remind the rep of a conversation that he or she had, uh, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 weeks prior. So they mean a lot, but without asking the person who wrote them, what it meant, we don't sit here, have any idea what it means.  
Speaker 2    07:29:27    If the, if the, um, Purdue sales rep calls on a doctor in Kentucky and explains to him that Oxy has less potential for abuse due to its sustained release, would that be improper? And the type of statement that was agreed was improper in the agreed statement of facts when Purdue pled guilty to a felony.  
Speaker 6    07:29:52    Okay. State the hypothe. Well, well, I could he just restate the hypothetical question?  
Speaker 2    07:30:00    Sure. If Purdue called, I want you to assume a hypothetical, if Purdue called on a doctor and said that, uh, OxyContin has less potential for abuse due to its sustained release, would that be the type of statement that would be inappropriate?  
Speaker 6    07:30:21    And when was that said, or you gonna set a time limit to it or a time period to that hypothetical?  
Speaker 2    07:30:28    No, I'm just a, trying to get an idea of what statements you consider inappropriate versus appropriate. Would that be an inappropriate statement for a rep to tell a doctor  
Speaker 6    07:30:36    Today? Yes.  
Speaker 2    07:30:38    Okay. Would it have been inappropriate from 1996 to 2001?  
Speaker 6    07:30:41    I'm not sure because I'd have to look at the package insert and could see, was that in the package insert or was it reasonably the same as what was in the package? Insert I'd have to do a textual analysis. It's close to what was in the package. Insert very close. Yeah. But it might have drifted away from the package insert. So that at that time it was inappropriate, but I'm not sure because I have to read the two, the hypothetical statement you put forward and the package insert to give you an opinion as to whether it has drifted away from the package. Insert.  
Speaker 2    07:31:29    It'd be pretty easy to tell if we looked at the agreed statement of facts because they outlined the comments they felt were improper between 1996 and 2001. Correct?  
Speaker 6    07:31:40    Uh, I didn't memorize the agreed statement of facts either, but yes, if that statement was an example of an inappropriate statement, obviously it would would've was we agreed. It was inappropriate.  
Speaker 2    07:31:53    And these call notes, you all actually required your, your representatives or salespeople to do call notes and instructed them to do 'em within minutes of completion of the call, correct?  
Speaker 6    07:32:07    That's correct.  
Speaker 2    07:32:08    And that's because the information recorded is generally more accurate when it's recorded immediately after the sales call while the events of the call are fresh in the representative's minds. Correct?  
Speaker 6    07:32:20    I don't think that that would be true in the way these call notes were used written or used when reviewed. I don't think it would've mattered if they had done it that evening. Okay. Um, but when the system was, or when that policy was established, whoever established, it probably had a different use in mind and expected them to be much, much more, much closer to a, he said, I said, he said, I said, he's interested in this. I have to get him an answer for that. And the notes I've seen so far depart so far from that, that I don't think it mattered whether they did it in a minute, an hour or a day. So long as the conversation was fresh in their mind. Uh, they sketched some notes to remind them of the conversation. A few weeks later, two to six weeks later,  
Speaker 2    07:33:35    When you disciplined people, how did you make a determination? Which ones needed to be disciplined? Um, sales reps needed to be disciplined.  
Speaker 6    07:33:45    I didn't discipline anybody. And so I was not asked to make a determination.  
Speaker 2    07:33:50    Okay. Do you know if the people who did make that determination relied on the call notes in determining whether discipline should take place?  
Speaker 6    07:33:57    I don't know.  
Speaker 2    07:33:58    Do you know if the reps in Kentucky were disciplined for having, uh, inappropriate call notes, uh, reflected, uh, uh, their conversations with physicians?  
Speaker 6    07:34:09    I don't know  
Speaker 2    07:34:14    If <affirmative>, if a sales rep went to a doctor and said, discuss lack of buzz, and this won't be drug seeking. Uh, would that be an inappropriate comment to make?  
Speaker 6    07:34:26    Could you form the comment for me since a hypothetical, as a sentence, and then I'll respond to it. If  
Speaker 2    07:34:32    A, if a sales rep went to a physician and said you don't get a buzz with OxyContin, would that be an inappropriate comment? Yes. If a sales rep went to a physician, I have to,  
Speaker 3    07:34:48    You go, you're going through a whole line of questioning where you have documents. You purport to be reading from them. You're not showing them to me. You're not showing 'em to the witness. I don't  
Speaker 2    07:34:56    Think it's fair. No, I'm asking him what types of questions a sales rep says and whether I've got notes or documents or I've got 'em in my head. Doesn't matter. I get to ask my question. You can follow up if  
Speaker 3    07:35:07    You appear to have documents in front of you that you're reading  
Speaker 2    07:35:09    From. Yeah. If a salesman went in and discussed abuse, potential and benefits of oxycodone or OxyContin, I'm sorry. Uh, and it not giving a euphoria, would that be inappropriate?  
Speaker 3    07:35:23    Objection.  
Speaker 6    07:35:28    I believe that would be inappropriate  
Speaker 2    07:35:34    If he tells him that there's less euphoria with OxyContin or he or she sales rep says there's less euphoria with OxyContin, OxyContin, would that be inappropriate,  
Speaker 6    07:35:51    Less amount of euphoria or less likely to be euphoria or something else?  
Speaker 2    07:36:01    Either of those?  
Speaker 6    07:36:13    I believe that today that would definitely be inappropriate.  
Speaker 2    07:36:19    Okay. Would it have been inappropriate in between 1996 and 2006?  
Speaker 6    07:36:26    I would have to study the package insert.  
Speaker 2    07:36:31    Okay. Let me, let me go back and talk about what, um, maybe this will, will help us here. Uh, under misbranding of OxyContin, there were several things that were brought up that were, um, were in, uh, inappropriate. And it says with the intent to defraud or mislead, are you reading, I'm reading from page five of the agreed statement of facts let's  
Speaker 6    07:37:02    Give, what number is that?  
Speaker 0    07:37:06    It's exhibit, um, 33.  
Speaker 6    07:37:08    Have to find it now. This is this it?  
Speaker 0    07:37:13    Yes. Yeah.  
Speaker 6    07:37:20    Um, where are you reading from please?  
Speaker 2    07:37:28    Page five, uh, paragraph 20 with the intent to defraud or mislead, or I'm sorry, let's back up. Purdue supervisors and employees between December 12th, 1995.  
Speaker 0    07:37:44    Again, you left out the word certain.  
Speaker 2    07:37:46    All right. Well, I'll just read it in its entirety then. Okay. Beginning on or about December 12th, 1995. And continuing on, or about June 30th, 2001, certain Purdue supervisors and employees with the intent to defraud or mislead, marketed, and promoted OxyContin as less addictive, less subject to abuse and diversion, less likely to cause tolerance and withdrawal than other pain medications. Did I read that correctly?  
Speaker 6    07:38:15    You, I think so. It's getting late. So I might have missed too  
Speaker 0    07:38:25    The basis of that.  
Speaker 2    07:38:26    And it was a review of the call notes by the us attorney's office that formed the basis of this plea agreement. Correct?  
Speaker 6    07:38:34    I don't know that.  
Speaker 2    07:38:40    Did you ever review any of the, uh, documents filed by the us attorney's office in the case? Were Purdue pled guilty to the felony?  
Speaker 6    07:38:52    No, I didn't. Um,  
Speaker 2    07:38:56    All right. And it, it says here  
Speaker 6    07:38:58    They didn't footnote the, these documents where they, so I don't even know if they, the documents, they reviewed millions of documents. I don't know whether they referenced any of the documents to this. I certainly couldn't have reviewed millions of documents. No one person could have done that.  
Speaker 2    07:39:30    Um, under number subparagraph E it says told certain healthcare providers that OxyContin did not cause a buzz or euphoria. And that would be improper, correct?  
Speaker 6    07:39:51    Depends on, oh, did not. Cause yes, that would be inappropriate,  
Speaker 2    07:39:58    Caused less euphoria had less addiction, potential had less abuse. Potential was less likely to be diverted than immediate release op opioids and could be used to weed out addicts and drug seekers  
Speaker 6    07:40:12    In its totality. It's inappropriate.  
Speaker 2    07:40:18    And one of the things that it points out in here, um, when we went on was the osteoarthritis study. Do you remember us talking about that?  
Speaker 6    07:40:27    I do.  
Speaker 2    07:40:36    Here's Carol Neil Heisel sales rep. This is William Ys, Dr. Florence, Kentucky, and the notes memo says brought osteoarthritis studies that show non addiction discussed how he could use Oxy to deter addictive behavior, less pills, less potential for abuse. Would you agree that those comments would be improper and inappropriate  
Speaker 6    07:41:04    If they were quotes of a transcript or of what he said? Yes, this is inappropriate.  
Speaker 2    07:41:21    And  
Speaker 6    07:41:22    In its totality, it's, it's inappropriate. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    07:41:25    <affirmative>  
Speaker 16    07:41:27    Are you planning to mark this as an exhibit?  
Speaker 2    07:41:29    I was not going to mark it. No. And it says here Purdue states that,  
Speaker 0    07:41:35    Uh,  
Speaker 2    07:41:39    I'm reading from the reply of the United States to defendant's response to blue cross blue shield of Tennessee and other private third party repairs request for restitution.  
Speaker 6    07:41:50    This is a new document, right? Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    07:41:52    <affirmative> right? Yeah. That's  
Speaker 6    07:41:56    Is this, is this an exhibit or not?  
Speaker 2    07:41:58    I just want to ask you about some of the information in here.  
Speaker 6    07:42:04    Can we just,  
Speaker 16    07:42:06    You're not gonna mark this as an exhibit either.  
Speaker 2    07:42:08    I  
Speaker 16    07:42:08    Wasn't. Can you identify it? So we'll know what it  
Speaker 2    07:42:10    Is. I, I thought I did. It's a reply of the United States, the defendant's response to blue cross blue shield. Um, it's, uh, I'm looking at the third paragraph. Purdue states an analysis of the notes that Purdue sales representatives kept from their visit to physicians revealed that less than 0.2% contain any evidence of statements that were arguably improper. And, um, were you aware that, that they had claimed that two tens of 1% of the sales notes were arguably improper,  
Speaker 6    07:42:45    As they say, actually here in their response were even arguably improper mm-hmm  
Speaker 2    07:42:51    <affirmative>, but the us attorney says this bear statistical reference does not provide a complete picture of the magnitude of the unlawful activity described in the information and the agreed statement of facts. These very, in fact, these very same notes show the pervasive nature of the false and misleading statements. For example, according to the notes in at least 41 states, physicians were informed that addicts would not like OxyContin or that OxyContin could be used to weed out drug seekers because addicts would not like it. And at least 49 states physicians were informed that OxyContin produces no buzz or euphoria. And in 50 states, physicians were informed that OxyContin had less abuse potential than other opioids. Would all of those comments be improper?  
Speaker 6    07:43:42    Those comments would be improper.  
Speaker 2    07:43:46    Yes. And it says, in addition, once Purdue learned of the investigation, it conducted training that cautioned sales representatives to avoid, including references to the false and misleading statements in their call notes. Eventually Purdue changed the call note system altogether to preclude such references by allowing sales representatives, to choose only from pre-selected menu items that not surprisingly omitted, the false and misleading statements that the employees had previously, that, that the employees previously had previously spontaneously recorded in the notes. Were you aware of that?  
Speaker 3    07:44:23    I objected form that question. You're showing the witness a, an argument written by the government and submitted to the court in a brief that this witness has never seen government arguments. And you're asking, he was aware  
Speaker 2    07:44:35    Of it. I'm asked. He was aware of that activity,  
Speaker 6    07:44:41    What activity  
Speaker 2    07:44:43    That, uh, once Purdue learned of the investigation, it conducted training that cautioned sales representatives to avoid, including references to the false and misleading statements in their call notes that's number. Were you aware they did that?  
Speaker 6    07:44:57    I don't think they did that.  
Speaker 2    07:44:58    And it says eventually Purdue changed the call note system altogether to preclude such references by allowing sales representatives, to choose from a pre-selected menu items that not surprisingly omitted the false and misleading statement that the employees had previously spontaneously recorded in their notes. Were you aware that that had occurred?  
Speaker 3    07:45:19    Well, I, I object you're assuming that something occurred based upon an argument of one party due litigation in a brief,  
Speaker 6    07:45:28    Can I verify that this occurred? I can't  
Speaker 0    07:45:39    The attorney, um,  
Speaker 2    07:45:52    The statements referenced, um, in the statement of facts under misbranding of OxyContin,  
Speaker 6    07:46:03    You don't even see a date on this,  
Speaker 3    07:46:05    But yeah.  
Speaker 2    07:46:06    Okay. Uh, the statements, I'm sorry.  
Speaker 6    07:46:08    Uh, are we on the same  
Speaker 2    07:46:10    Document or not? No, I'm, I'm asking you about the degree statement of facts now.  
Speaker 6    07:46:14    Oh, okay. We're back to that. Okay.  
Speaker 2    07:46:17    The statement under misbranding of OxyContin, uh,  
Speaker 6    07:46:21    What page or what number?  
Speaker 2    07:46:22    Page five. You've read, uh, paragraph 20 in its entirety, correct?  
Speaker 6    07:46:41    Yep. I had read it, but it might help me to read it again, but why don't you pose your question?  
Speaker 2    07:46:48    Yeah. Are those the statements that, uh, were improper and constituted the, um, guilty plea?  
Speaker 6    07:47:01    Uh, Purdue Frederick?  
Speaker 2    07:47:02    Yes.  
Speaker 3    07:47:03    Can I hear the question again? I just missed, yeah.  
Speaker 2    07:47:05    Yeah. The statements outlined in paragraph 20, are those the improper, uh, and misleading statements that were made with intent to defraud, um, by produce sales force. Um, does that set them forth?  
Speaker 0    07:47:26    Yeah. Yeah.  
Speaker 6    07:47:28    I, I don't know to me, this is, this is almost illegal question, and I'd like to know whether our attorneys would agree with this or not. These are some of the statements that are in here. I think there are others. So I'm not sure that you mean, is this all and nothing else or  
Speaker 2    07:47:53    What? I don't mean. I just mean other paragraph 20. Okay. Would that constitute, um, um,  
Speaker 6    07:48:00    Examples  
Speaker 2    07:48:01    Of examples of inappropriate, um, and that's  
Speaker 6    07:48:05    What  
Speaker 2    07:48:05    Misleading statements  
Speaker 3    07:48:06    I object to the question. It's been a long exam or late in the day, and now you seem to be going over the agreed statement, facts again, and asking the witness what the agreed statement of facts says, what it says is written in the agreed statement of facts, which  
Speaker 0    07:48:21    You written through.  
Speaker 2    07:48:24    Yes.  
Speaker 3    07:48:29    I don't know where this is getting us this late hour. I think it's, it's starting to border up harassment.  
Speaker 2    07:48:34    Can you read my question back?  
Speaker 12    07:48:48    I just mean under paragraph 20, would that constitute examples of inappropriate and misleading statements?  
Speaker 6    07:48:55    Should I answer,  
Speaker 0    07:48:57    Uh, I object that you can answer?  
Speaker 6    07:49:00    Yes.  
Speaker 2    07:49:11    If, uh, a sales rep told a doctor that using OxyContin would provide smoother blood levels, would that be an appropriate statement?  
Speaker 6    07:49:27    I don't know that if smoother blood levels was not in the package, insert, it may not. It might be an inappropriate statement, but I'm not sure that it wasn't in the, in the package insert it's, although it might be inappropriate. I don't know. It would have been true depending upon what was meant by smoother, smoother is not a medical term for, or a pharmacokinetic term. It's an opinion of, it's a term that somebody might apply to a graph. It's a smoother line. It's not a smoother line, but it, it's not really a clear statement. And thus, I can't say it's clearly right. Or clearly wrong. Um, it would have been fine if that terminology was in the package insert. I don't know whether it was  
Speaker 2    07:50:34    All right. What information did you review to prepare for your deposition today?  
Speaker 6    07:50:40    Documents,  
Speaker 2    07:50:41    Which documents?  
Speaker 6    07:50:43    Um, not too many of the ones you've shown me. Um, this agreed statement of facts we reviewed in part, am I supposed to answer this? I mean, I don't.  
Speaker 2    07:50:56    Um, yes. Any other documents that you reviewed  
Speaker 6    07:51:00    That I recall and can describe to you? Yes. No.  
Speaker 2    07:51:05    You did say you reviewed six less than eight call notes, is that right? Yes. And that was the first time you'd seen call notes. Yes.  
Speaker 6    07:51:14    This was the second time. And as I said, they are both, both experiences are the same. They are so fragmentary that they can mean. It's impossible to know really what was said. That's why you had to pose hypothetical statements.  
Speaker 2    07:51:38    Yes. Purdue Pharma LP, Purdue Pharma, Inc. The Purdue Frederick company, Purdue Pharmaceuticals LP, PF Laboratories, Inc. Do you know if they have the same directors or are there different directors for those entities?  
Speaker 6    07:51:57    I don't know.  
Speaker 2    07:52:05    Um, do you currently practice medicine?  
Speaker 6    07:52:10    No. Not practice in the sense that I have an office or an see patients by appointment? No, I  
Speaker 2    07:52:16    Don't. When is the last time that you practice medicine  
Speaker 6    07:52:20    In 1974? During my residency?  
Speaker 2    07:52:33    Uh, from 1999 to 2002. You were the president of Purdue Pharma LP  
Speaker 6    07:52:39    From the very last days of 99 until March of 2003.  
Speaker 2    07:52:45    Were you also at some point, uh, the president of Purdue Frederick?  
Speaker 6    07:52:50    I don't think so.  
Speaker 2    07:52:51    No. Did you have any, uh, office, uh, title at Purdue Frederick?  
Speaker 6    07:52:58    I did.  
Speaker 2    07:52:58    What was that  
Speaker 6    07:52:59    Title? I was a senior vice president. Okay.  
Speaker 2    07:53:03    And do you know when you relinquished that title?  
Speaker 6    07:53:07    I don't recall, but it probably was either simultaneous with ending my presidency at Purdue Pharma or before.  
Speaker 2    07:53:32    Um, there are different types of corporations. There are not for profit corporations. Uh, and there are for-profit corporations. Would I be correct that Purdue Frederick and Purdue Pharma are for-profit corporations. There  
Speaker 6    07:53:50    Are for-profit businesses, but not all of the companies that you've named are corporations.  
Speaker 2    07:54:00    All right. Um, that's a good distinction. Uh, would I be correct that Purdue Frederick or Purdue Pharma are for profit? Not, not for profit.  
Speaker 6    07:54:12    They're for profit. Okay.  
Speaker 2    07:54:20    Go off the record a minute.  
Speaker 1    07:54:22    We are off the record at 7:18 PM. We are back on the record at 7:39 PM.  
Speaker 2    07:54:30    All, yeah. All right, let's go back through, um, I'm gonna hand you a document that is, um, at the top. Let's mark this as exhibit 38 38. It's from Richard Sackler. Did you recognize that?  
Speaker 6    07:54:50    I recognize the name. Okay.  
Speaker 2    07:54:52    All right. Was this an email that you sent to Michael Friedman?  
Speaker 6    07:54:58    Yep.  
Speaker 2    07:54:59    And it says here under importance, uh, down below importance, low, but down below it says, why don't you guys plan a presentation about addiction that could be given first by R or BK now, who are those individuals,  
Speaker 6    07:55:15    Robert Reeder or Bob Keiko.  
Speaker 2    07:55:19    And, uh, and eventually by our senior managed healthcare people next paragraph, I think that Paul has a good point, but we should consider that quote addiction in quote, maybe a convenient way to quote, just say no. And when this objection is obliterated, they will fall back on the question of cost, unless we can give a convincing presentation that CR products that's controlled release products is that yes, are less prone to addiction, potential abuse or diversion than IR products that immediate release.  
Speaker 6    07:55:58    Yes mm-hmm  
Speaker 2    07:55:59    <affirmative> I think that this can be done, but I defer to BK and rrr and other experts.  
Speaker 6    07:56:06    Yes.  
Speaker 2    07:56:07    And what were you trying to accomplish there by trying to show that, uh, <affirmative> that, um, controlled release products are less prone to addiction abuse or diversion than immediate release products?  
Speaker 6    07:56:25    Well, I wasn't trying to show anything. I was basically asking a question and if the answer were, yes, we can put together, uh, a good, effective and medically correct presentation. I thought it would be useful to do so, but I was asking them, can we do that? Do we have the information? Do we have the data? And obviously, um, if we had contrary information or data, uh, then obviously you couldn't do that.  
Speaker 2    07:57:04    Are you aware of any presentation showing that, um, controlled release products are less prone to addiction, potential abuse or diversion than immediate release products no. Was ever done?  
Speaker 6    07:57:17    I don't think so, but I don't remember, um, how this came to an end. Uh, I put on low in importance to indicate it was, uh, not something that was urgent. It was an idea I had and I said, could, can we do this?  
Speaker 2    07:57:45    All right. And then the another email I'm gonna hand you that one. Thank you, mark. This as exhibit 39. And this is dated, um, looks like at the bottom analgesic plans, Dr. Richard Sackler at Norwalk. Uh, and is this an email that you sent?  
Speaker 6    07:58:34    Yes, it's quite a dense email.  
Speaker 2    07:58:51    And if you go back to page three, uh, the email that proceeded, it was from John Stewart. Yes. Who is John Stewart?  
Speaker 6    07:58:59    He was the general manager in Canada, PF Canada.  
Speaker 2    07:59:06    And is that a Purdue Pharma affiliate?  
Speaker 6    07:59:09    It's an affiliated company. Yes.  
Speaker 2    07:59:11    Does, does the Sackler family own PF Canada? Yes.  
Speaker 6    07:59:14    Yes we do.  
Speaker 2    07:59:21    He says, um, under the first paragraph, in my opinion, the action that will produce the greatest sales gains are the acquisition of IMS practice, quartile data, and the resulting improvement in targeting of our sales and marketing activities. Um, what does that mean  
Speaker 6    07:59:45    In the United States? From the inception of the launch of OxyContin, we focused our salesman's attention to physicians who were, uh, based on their history, uh, physicians whose practice and their practice was to use, write a lot of prescriptions for opioids. We didn't go to people who didn't write them. We went to people who did, and I don't recall whether this practice was or was not done in PF, but I might have learned in a meeting that they were not doing it and they could not purchase the same data source from IMS in Canada, but they appeared to have had something that would've been similar, where they divided physicians into quartiles.  
Speaker 2    08:00:52    Okay. And if you look at your response to him, um, on 9 27 96, you say your most important question to me was, have physicians been reluctant to use Oxy PRN? What does Oxy PRN mean?  
Speaker 6    08:01:13    I assume that Oxy referred to OxyContin PRN would mean as needed  
Speaker 2    08:01:19    In place of IR forms of oxycodone and that's immediate release oxycodone. Correct. Right. Uh, I've not asked this question, but judging from the very strong sales performance and continuing growth, I would guess that this has not been a problem. I think that we're this the case, it would be because of the very rapid rate of onset parenthesis, as fast as IR oxycodone, that is 45 minutes versus 41 minutes for the IR form, not even close to a significant clinical or statistical difference. And was it your understanding when you wrote this, that OxyContin controlled release did not have a significant clinical statistical difference with rate of onset when compared to oxycodone immediate release?  
Speaker 6    08:02:20    That's correct. This was drawn from a study mm-hmm <affirmative> that was done, uh, onset is not defined here, but it was a medical term in the trial that I believe John Stewart had either been given or was familiar with, which basically recorded the first instance that the patient said, oh, I'm beginning to feel better. My pain is less. That was meant by onset. That was the meaning of onset in that trial. And that was what I was quoting from.  
Speaker 2    08:03:02    And it says here, the fast rise character now, quote, parenthesis. Now a patent in the us, in parenthesis of the drug combined with familiarity and a marketing program that emphasized that IR was the old was, I think that's supposed to be way yes. And OxyContin tablets are the new way to treat moderate to severe pain has resulted in our success. Did I read that correctly?  
Speaker 6    08:03:33    You read, you read very correctly. What is written here  
Speaker 2    08:03:37    And when it says the fast rise character you're referring to OxyContin having a fast rise as par as far as when relief occurs, correct?  
Speaker 6    08:03:50    Yes.  
Speaker 2    08:03:52    Um, and then down below that, if you go to about the fourth paragraph, the overall schema that marketing here has worked R four, three of the four, I think that's out of three of the four should probably be, but it's written yes. The overall schema that marketing here has worked R four, three of the four is Oxy one IR old way, OxyContin tablet, new way emphasizing the B I D was Q4 H versus  
Speaker 6    08:04:25    Versus  
Speaker 2    08:04:27    Q4, V I D versus Q4 H and underscoring. The similarity of onset. Other differential benefits are emphasized such as range of doses, the very small tablets, etcetera. And then Oxy two. Uh, your second point with ING, Oxy is in cancer and severe nonmalignant pain. The one to start with and the one to stay with here, we are going directly after the MSC and Duragesic business. What is MSC  
Speaker 6    08:04:57    MS. Contin  
Speaker 2    08:05:00    And Duragesic who made Duragesic  
Speaker 6    08:05:03    J and J.  
Speaker 2    08:05:04    And you say, clearly this is highlighted or capitalized. Clearly this strategy has outperformed our expectations, market research and fondest dreams.  
Speaker 6    08:05:18    Yes.  
Speaker 2    08:05:18    I read that correctly.  
Speaker 6    08:05:19    You did.  
Speaker 2    08:05:22    Um, alright. And then the last one I want to ask you about  
Speaker 6    08:05:28    There's no question.  
Speaker 0    08:05:34    Okay.  
Speaker 2    08:05:41    When you say it outperformed your fondest dreams, you're talking in terms of market share and what it was earning, is that correct?  
Speaker 6    08:05:49    It's uh, the overall sales trajectory.  
Speaker 2    08:05:59    And then  
Speaker 0    08:06:01    Thank you. Yep.  
Speaker 2    08:06:02    One more email to ask you about who was, oh, I'm sorry. Let's mark this as number 40. Um, did you read the sales bulletins, uh, when you were the, um, are they, um, when these were sent to you?  
Speaker 6    08:06:25    Uh, I was senior vice president. Um, not generally. I might have scanned this. I didn't read them carefully. They were very carefully crafted by sales and marketing people and, and, and others. And I didn't usually read them,  
Speaker 2    08:06:50    Uh, who is Russ Gaia.  
Speaker 6    08:06:53    Russ was then either a district manager or a regional manager.  
Speaker 2    08:07:03    And this is January 25th, 1999 prescription sales force. Does that mean it went out to everybody?  
Speaker 6    08:07:12    No, it probably means it went out to salesmen who were doing, who were selling prescription products.  
Speaker 2    08:07:20    Would it have gone to everyone selling OxyContin?  
Speaker 6    08:07:24    Oh, I believe so.  
Speaker 2    08:07:25    Yes. And, um, the first paragraph says effective with the first quarter, 1999, Ms. Cotton sales volume and growth.  
Speaker 6    08:07:42    First paragraph I see as was announced. Okay.  
Speaker 2    08:07:48    As was announced at the national meeting. Right.  
Speaker 6    08:07:50    Skip that. Okay. Right. I, you just  
Speaker 2    08:07:53    Effective with the first quarter, 1999, Ms. Cotton sales volume and growth, as well as quota will be calculated at 50 cents.  
Speaker 6    08:08:00    Okay. I'm I'm not following you. Can you just show me where  
Speaker 0    08:08:04    I had the same problem? I, I don't know where you're reading from  
Speaker 2    08:08:11    The first paragraph.  
Speaker 6    08:08:13    Okay. I'm looking for effective. Oh, I see. Okay. Sorry. Yeah, these are small and I can't read them that fast. I I'm now following you. Okay. Let  
Speaker 2    08:08:24    Me give you this one and we'll make it the exhibit. Uh,  
Speaker 6    08:08:29    Okay. This is I I'm following you now. Sure.  
Speaker 2    08:08:37    Uh, so let's read the first paragraph as was announced at the national sales meeting effective with the first quarter, 1999, Ms. Cotton sales, volume, and growth, as well as quota will be calculated at 50 cents for every $1. What does that mean?  
Speaker 6    08:08:53    I I'm, I can't be sure, but I think that we were reducing the bone, seeing the bonus for Ms. Cotton. I'd have to read the whole thing to be sure of that. Would you like me to read it all?  
Speaker 2    08:09:09    Uh that's all right. I'm gonna read it with you here. Oh, okay. Next sentence says, so then OxyContin sales, volume and growth, as well as quota will be calculated at $1 and 15 cents for every $1.  
Speaker 6    08:09:22    Again, uh, it was deemphasizing Ms. Cotton sales growth and increasing the incentive by a small amount on OxyContin sales growth.  
Speaker 2    08:09:36    And then the next paragraph says early estimates indicate that the fourth quarter 1998 bonus payout will be another record payout. Remember this record payout came at a time when we were utilizing a factor of 55 cents for every Ms. Cotton dollar and a dollar 15 for every OxyContin dollar, as we continue to drive more business toward OxyContin, each of you will benefit significantly from the factoring of a $1 and 15 cent for every $1 of OxyContin. And again, is that referring to D uh, incentivizing MS. Contin cells and incentivizing OxyContin cells?  
Speaker 6    08:10:19    Yes. We were moving the incentive program to focus on OxyContin and <affirmative> and every time you take an incentive program, reduce it. You have at least in some of the people who are affected some strong negative feelings. And that's probably why there was a small increase to OxyContin. Looks like it was 15%, but I'm I interpolating here? I don't recall. I certainly didn't read this and I don't recall the details of the incentive compensation well, enough to be sure.  
Speaker 2    08:11:02    And then it says, as pointed out your priority is to sell, sell, sell, um, and that's in bold OxyContin, right? Well, and is that what the sales force was instructed to do?  
Speaker 6    08:11:18    That's what he said they were instructed to do, but they were instructed to do their best to sell OxyContin. Yes, this was a sales force related kind of Rah-rah piece.  
Speaker 17    08:11:40    And  
Speaker 2    08:11:42    It also says in the last paragraph remain focused on positioning OxyContin as the opioid to start with and stay with in chronic malignant and non-malignant pain states. In addition, continue to aggressively position OxyContin for use in osteoarthritis, low back pain, post neuropathic neurology, and post-surgical applications where appropriate finally continue to highlight the advantages of OxyContin, especially for use in the elderly. If you have any questions regarding the bonus calculations for the first quarter of 99, please contact your district manager  
Speaker 6    08:12:17    That tells me he was a regional manager. Then,  
Speaker 2    08:12:22    Um, have you made any, uh, effort or as we sit here today, do you know how many patients who took OxyContin in Kentucky became dependent or addicted?  
Speaker 6    08:12:36    No.  
Speaker 2    08:12:41    Do you believe that, um, an inappropriate number of patients or an excessive number of patients who took OxyContin in Kentucky became, uh, addicted or dependent?  
Speaker 6    08:12:56    No.  
Speaker 2    08:13:00    Do you know, uh, or has Purdue made any effort to ascertain ascertained? Um, how many people who were started on OxyContin wound up becoming dependent and moving on to heroin at some point?  
Speaker 0    08:13:18    No. Anything else?  
Speaker 2    08:13:49    I think it's all questions I have Dr. Sackler. Thank you very much.  
Speaker 6    08:13:53    Are we finished or maybe not. I dunno,  
Speaker 0    08:13:57    You're done.  
Speaker 1    08:13:59    That is the conclusions of this deposition. It is we're off the record at 7:58 PM.  
Speaker 0    08:14:04    Just to, to.
