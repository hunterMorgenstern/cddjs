We were of the contrary opinion, but he said he came back and he did quite a bit of work without any reference to anybody else on determining or trying to get the B farm to consider de not scheduling it. And this whole stream was occasioned by that we, many of us in the us were not enthusiastic about not scheduling it in Germany.

We, we put in place, for example, a whole compliance department in 2003 or 2004 with many employees who reported independently to the board and have continued to report independently to the board, um, to, in a sense back up the sales department and marketing department's own efforts to assure, uh, proper training and compliance with training. Um, but I don't know of any attempt to measure, uh, who said what and how many times, uh, when people were properly trained and, and they deviated from that, or went beyond that, uh, they were sanctioned and many of them were dismissed. We also had a whole downsizing in the field force from about 2000 3 0 4 until about 2007 or eight. Um, in which the 800 eventually went down to something like 200.
