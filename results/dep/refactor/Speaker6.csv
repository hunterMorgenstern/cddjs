"The topic the person is talking about is the use of the words ""weaker"" and ""stronger"" to describe morphine.","The person's points are that the words ""weaker"" and ""stronger"" do not necessarily mean less or more potent, respectively, and that the use of these words is unfortunate because they carry a lot of stigma.","The facts are that the person understands that the words ""weaker"" and ""stronger"" do not necessarily mean less or more potent.",There are no anecdotes given.,N/A,"He's using the word weaker, but not meaning less potent than morphine within at this time, it appears that people had fallen into a habit of signifying less, frightening, less threatening, more patient acceptable as under the rubric of weaker or more frightening, more, less acceptable, um, and less desirable under the rubric or words stronger. But we knew that that the word weaker did not mean less potent. We knew that the word stronger did not mean more potent. And we knew that because by this time surely anybody who was using this product recognized it was more potent. They knew it was more potent. So it's very unfortunate for your understanding as well as anybody else's understanding that, that all those issues of the stigma of morphine, of the frightening nature of morphine, of morphine being a cancer drug end of life drug, it's a very unfortunate for your understanding. And for most people's understanding that the word weaker and stronger was used. We understood what it meant."
