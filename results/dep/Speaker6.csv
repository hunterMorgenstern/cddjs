The topic the person is talking about is treating pain with opioids.,The person's points are that opioids can help treat pain and that there is an indication for opioids to be used for treating pain.,The facts are that opioids can help treat pain and that there is an indication for opioids to be used for treating pain.,There are no anecdotes.,There are no quotes.,"Well, it, it, it, those are most typically moderate pain patients. Some of them may be severe, but there are many less common conditions that produce severe crippling life destroying pain. And we had an indication and still have for all pain states that are appropriately treatable with opioids for an extended period of time. We want it. So nonmalignant really is a distinction, all pain, other than the pain directly caused by the encroachment and destruction of tumor tissue in the patient"

The whole context was not to"
The topic is whether or not oxycodone should be stigmatized in the same way as morphine.,"The person's points are that they don't want oxycodone to be associated with the same negative connotations as morphine, because then patients and health caregivers would be less likely to want to use it.","The facts are that morphine was often seen as a death sentence by patients and health caregivers, and that this made it less likely to be used even when it was needed.",There are no anecdotes.,N/A,"The context was not to stigmatize oxycodone in a way that morphine was stigmatized. Morphine was seen as an end of life, extreme duress patient and extreme duress, often dying of cancer, but not only cancer, it was reserved by most physicians, if it was used at all, even when patients were in serious, severe, or even crippling pain, because telling a patient, um, I'm gonna put you on morphine. I'm gonna prescribe morphine for you. Uh, now we got to use morphine. However, the physician told the patient it often was associated with a death sentence. Oh, thinks the patient he's telling me I'm gonna die. Even worse. My doctor's putting me on morphine. He's giving up on me. We didn't want oxycodone to, to change the, as he says, personality of oxycodone, but you could say all the associated feelings of oxycodone, which were generally appropriate to a narcotic. We didn't want that to be polluted by all of the bad associations that patients and health caregivers had with morphine."
The topic the person is talking about is the drug OxyContin.,"The person's points are that the drug could be useful if it wasn't stigmatized, and that it was twice as potent as morphine.",The facts are that the drug was called out in promotional literature and reflected in a conversion chart.,There are no anecdotes.,N/A,"No, uh, if it, if its personality was changed, if it was stigmatized as an end of life drug, it could limit its usefulness. The term stronger here meant more threatening, more frightening. There is no way that this intended or had the effect of causing physicians to overlook the fact that it was twice as potent. It was called out in virtually every promotional piece of literature. It was reflected in a conversion chart, which we had developed for the few patients who were being treated with morphine, where we made it very clear. If they're on any dose daily dose of morphine, you cut that dose in half for OxyContin. Um, and every action we took before the product was launched with the FDA in the package, insert in promotion and in all detailing emphasized that it was twice as strong. Some physicians had formed their own impression that it wasn't twice as strong. It was less strong. And we insisted that they observe, we said with this drug doctor, it is twice as strong, even when they said, no, I think it's one and a half times as strong. And some physicians even said, I think it's about the same potency as morphine. We would insist, no, please use it the way we have researched it. And the way the FDA has approved it now. And I think we were effective in getting that message across in time to most eventually almost all physicians."
The topic is a drug that is twice as potent as morphine.,"The person's points are that they agreed with the idea when it was first brought up, and they still agree with it now. They think that everybody knows what is meant by the idea and that it is more important than ever.","The facts are that the person never wavered in their support for the idea, and they never disguised or hit it.",There are no anecdotes.,N/A,"Of the I did. And I agreed with him then, and I agreed with him now because I knew what he meant. And so did everybody else know, knew what he meant and more important. Our actions in promoting that twice as potent as morphine never wavered, we never disguised it or hit it. We emphasized it."
The topic they are talking about is the sales of OxyContin.,They think that the person is not addressing the question.,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Testimony? No, no. That isn't, uh, we, the, we wanted to address both markets, the email, which perhaps you want to explore or not that started. This was, as he says in the first paragraph, something that I had inquired about and what I had inquired about was an error on my part. When we, before we launched OxyContin, we thought that our sales would be about equally divided between cancer, pain, and nonmalignant pain. We knew that the market for nonmalignant pain was much larger. Of course, fortunately for all of us, cancer is not as much less common than other pain states, but we had expected, it would be about 50 50. I had seen some reporter that attended a meeting where I learned it was about 20% of our sales. And thus, I wrote to Michael and said, why, what what's going on here? Why aren't we getting more cancer sales?"

"The topic the person is talking about is the use of the words ""weaker"" and ""stronger"" to describe morphine.","The person's points are that the words ""weaker"" and ""stronger"" do not necessarily mean less or more potent, respectively, and that the use of these words is unfortunate because they carry a lot of stigma.","The facts are that the person understands that the words ""weaker"" and ""stronger"" do not necessarily mean less or more potent.",There are no anecdotes given.,N/A,"He's using the word weaker, but not meaning less potent than morphine within at this time, it appears that people had fallen into a habit of signifying less, frightening, less threatening, more patient acceptable as under the rubric of weaker or more frightening, more, less acceptable, um, and less desirable under the rubric or words stronger. But we knew that that the word weaker did not mean less potent. We knew that the word stronger did not mean more potent. And we knew that because by this time surely anybody who was using this product recognized it was more potent. They knew it was more potent. So it's very unfortunate for your understanding as well as anybody else's understanding that, that all those issues of the stigma of morphine, of the frightening nature of morphine, of morphine being a cancer drug end of life drug, it's a very unfortunate for your understanding. And for most people's understanding that the word weaker and stronger was used. We understood what it meant."

Their own practice proved that they recognized it was more potent. As I said before, Percocet was five milligrams."
The topic they are talking about is morphine.,They think that morphine is less potent than other drugs.,The facts are that morphine is less potent than other drugs.,They do not support their point with anecdotes.,N/A,Morphine. You're talking about less potent.
The topic is AR.,"The person's points are that AR is more potent than morphine, and that this is generally accepted by physicians.",The facts are that AR is more potent than morphine.,The person does not support their points with anecdotes.,N/A,"I don't know of such studies, but in common parlance and discussions with physicians, if really a substantial, if, if any substantial number of them believed, believed in the AR believed in an, had a erroneous belief, excuse me, if any, held an erroneous belief and said to a representative, oh, this is, this stuff is, is less potent than morphine. The salesman was had ample materials to demonstrate the physician that he was in error and was instructed to use those and did use it. And I wish we had a survey, had done a survey to demonstrate it in retrospect, but it was so generally the accepted that it was at least one and a half times more, more potent by even the skeptics, most skeptics. And there weren't many, but generally recognized to be twice as potent as morphine. It just never occurred to us."

The topic the person is talking about is pain management with opioids.,"The person's points are that titration is the fundamental doctrine of treating pain with opioids, and that starting low is important.","The facts are that titration is the fundamental doctrine of treating pain with opioids, and that starting low is important.",There are no anecdotes.,N/A,"But they would be taught the same thing how to titrate, because that was the, that was in a sense, the fundamental doctrine of treating pain with opioids start low and titrate."

The topic they are talking about is not being correct.,They think it is not correct.,The facts are that it is not correct.,They do not support their point with anecdotes.,They do not quote any anecdotes.,"No, not correct."
The topic the person is talking about is the change to the drug.,The person's points are that the change to the drug may not be necessary and that it is not as strong as some people think.,The facts are that the change to the drug may not be necessary and that it is not as strong as some people think.,There are no anecdotes.,There are no quotes.,"Don't change the personality. Don't change this to an end of life, cancer drug to a drug that shouldn't be used except at the end of life. Uh, when everything else has been exhausted, that was the thrust. I may just add something here. There's a conflation within this, which you wouldn't understand. And that was when, in the first paragraph, which you read where he said that oncologists think it isn't as strong as Ms. Cotton here. The meaning that we understood, certainly I understood. And anybody who was involved was the cancer doctors who were using the drug were stopping at, they had established emotionalized list, notional idea based on their past habit of using Percocet, that they shouldn't go above 40 to 60 milligrams a day of oxycodone. And the reason they developed that habit, that practice limit was not because of the oxycodone. It was because of the Tylenol, which was the more toxic agent in that combination."
The topic the person is talking about is the FDA's recommendation to lower the maximum daily Tylenol dose.,"The person's points are that oncologists were in the habit of using oxycodone as Percocet, and that was why the use of OxyContin had not developed as well as hoped.","The facts are that the FDA recommended lowering the maximum daily Tylenol dose, and that oncologists were in the habit of using oxycodone as Percocet.",There are no anecdotes.,There is no quote.,"You're probably aware that recently the FDA has recommended lowering the maximum daily Tylenol dose from four grams a day to three. And, but even then four grams a day was recognized as being the, the then practical limit. So oncologists who were using oxycodone as Percocet were just in the habit, well, you're getting 40 milligrams a day of oxycodone. Your pain is coming back rather than titrate those patients to a higher OxyContin level. They said, well, we gotta switch to something else. And that was really what was going on. And in part, why oncologists use of the product had not developed as well as we had wished that it would develop. And that was understood and contained within this dialogue. Not all of it documented here."
The topic the person is talking about is the effectiveness of OxyContin.,"The person's points are that OxyContin is not as effective as originally thought, and that the reason for this is because people did not follow the proper dosage instructions.","The facts are that most people who disagreed with the effectiveness of OxyContin thought it was only 1.5 times stronger than morphine, and that by 1997, most of the people who disagreed with OxyContin had been persuaded to switch from MS. Contin to OxyContin.",There are no anecdotes.,N/A,"You're, that's what the words say. But the meaning of strong here would be effective. It is not as effective. And the reason they thought it was not as effective is they had a mental notion of a limit and they didn't follow the doctrine of titrating increasing the dose when the pain is getting worse. And all of this was, was really known. I mean, by 1997, most of the people who disagreed and thought that OxyContin was not two to one, they thought it was one and a half to one that was by far the most common objection, still stronger than morphine, but not quite as much stronger as we said it was, they had been persuaded if they used the drug. Oh yes. Particularly, uh, those oncologists who switched from MS. Contin to OxyContin."
The topic the person is talking about is a new drug that is more acceptable to the patient and not as stigmatized as morphine.,The person's points are that the drug is more acceptable to the patient and not as stigmatized as morphine.,The facts are that the drug is more acceptable to the patient and not as stigmatized as morphine.,There are no anecdotes.,There is no quote.,"Not, not less potent, um, more acceptable to the patient, not frightening, not stigmatized as morphine unfairly was by history. Um, that was the meaning. And I've lost my thought here. Could you just repeat your question so I can finish my answer?"
"The topic is that the terms ""stronger"" and ""weaker"" are unfortunate terms.","The person's points are that the terms ""stronger"" and ""weaker"" are unfortunate terms.","The facts are that the terms ""stronger"" and ""weaker"" are unfortunate terms.",There are no anecdotes.,There are no quotes.,"Morphine. Again, as I've testified before the term stronger and weaker. Was it an very unfortunate term you"
The topic is the use of OxyContin.,The person's points are that the product is effective and that it was introduced properly.,The facts are that the product is effective and that it was introduced properly.,There are no anecdotes.,There are no quotes.,"In the case of here effective? Yes. In the case of cancer because they were using it. Let me explain one other thing. Um, at the time that this product was introduced, the world health organization had promulgated a step ladder approach to cancer pain. And when OxyContin was introduced, we properly with the agreement of the FDA said that Emma, uh, that OxyContin was appropriate for the second step and the third step that's where the start with and stay with theme came from. Um, so, uh, I, I, I know that this could cause real confusion reading these documents if you're not involved day to day, but there is no way that any of the people on these documents understood stronger to mean less, more potent weaker to mean less potent. We had never departed from a strong promotional theme that it was twice as strong as morphine."
The person is talking about the effectiveness of the medication.,The person's points are that the oncologists who said the medication wasn't effective were likely wrong and that the pain relief the medication provides is likely due to the oncologists' mental limits.,The facts are that the oncologists who said the medication wasn't effective were likely wrong and that the pain relief the medication provides is likely due to the oncologists' mental limits.,There are no anecdotes.,There are no quotes.,"No. I said the effectiveness really applied to the oncologists who were saying, ah, this isn't as effective. Or I, you know, I have to, you know, when the pain pain gets really bad, I switch 'em to something else. And that was the one place or the one circumstance in which we would've understood it as effective. And I've explained that we believe that that was a consequence of them just having a mental limit."

You might change their perception. We didn't believe that that was appropriate nor did the FDA, nor did the opinion. Leaders believe it was appropriate. It truly was a drug that an appropriate doses could manage moderate and severe and extremely severe pain where patients needed an opioid to manage their pain. It's important also that you understand that for a hundred years. And even today, there is no drug that is more effective or safer than opioids for treating pain over the long term. And it was a shame that when that for, for decades, no opioid was used, uh, in many, most perhaps overwhelming majority of patients who had severe pain."

Um, the doctrine, uh, of using opioids is to titrate to effect, but in some conditions, cancer and others, the dose that has in general, a good effect may suddenly be insubstantial due to what's called breakthrough pain. And breakthrough pain could be the occasion by movement or trauma, or just occasion by the fluctuation in the pain state, rather than maintaining a patient on the highest number of milligrams of any opioid around the clock, just to prevent breakthrough pain, the normal practice. And I think it's the prudent and safest practice is to give the patient an immediate release form ideally of the same analgesic agent that they can take when they have breakthrough pain on a as needed basis."

Normally people take a Tylenol tablet every, or two tablets every four hours, but they will get essentially the same effect. If they take one tablet, every two hours. What we had found was in most patients, this was found as the drug was marketed, who complained that at eight or nine hours, they were back in pain. Yes, they could be treated every three, three times a day. But if you took that dosage daily dose and divided it twice a day, Q 12 hours, they were just as pleased with the pain relief. It was simply that the physician, perhaps by habit or for other reasons, rather than increasing the twice a day dose increase the daily dose by telling the patient, well, take it every eight hours and it would work fine."

The topic the person is talking about is pain research.,"The person's points are that the study may have been convincing to the FDA, but it is not the only study that led to that conclusion and that measuring pain is difficult because it is a personal experience.",The facts are that the study was conducted at McGill University in the 1950s and that measuring pain is difficult because it is a personal experience.,There are no anecdotes.,N/A,"The F I can't tell you why, whether this was the study that convinced the FDA of that. Um, but it's certainly, it's not the finding is completely consistent with that. There may have been other studies that led them to that conclusion with this being just supportive of that conclusion in pain studies. I, I might point out that the biggest advance in measuring pain, which of course is a personal experience. No doctor can look at you and say, oh, you've got a pain level of three, and you have a pain level of six. There's no way of doing it. You have to depend on the patient's report. And the huge advance that led to all the research in analgesia and pain relief was called the McGill visual analog scale that was developed in the fifties in McGill university. Uh, in Montreal,"

And needless to say, I suspect everybody in this room has gone to a doctor where they say, do you have pain? And if you say, or to a nurse, when they take your blood pressure, yes, I have pain. And they ask you to rate it. That is clearly better than just saying patient has pain, plus yes or no, but it's not a lot better. It's not terribly, it's not reproducible. And it is highly influenced by the environment and other factors that affect the report that the patient gives. So very often you can compare a highly effective pain reliever to a placebo, and you get in the study, no difference. And that is widely recognized. And that probably related to the study that you talked about earlier, um, the FDA, however, would've required studies that showed a difference and they did before they would approve the product. In other words, the negative didn't was dismissed as a failed study by the FDA, the positive studies control, because"
The topic is oxycodone.,The person's points are that the study was done but it was inconclusive and that oxycodone is indisputably effective in treating pain.,The facts are that the study was done but it was inconclusive and that oxycodone is indisputably effective in treating pain.,There are no anecdotes.,N/A,"As a policy study, I don't know it was dismissed. It was studied, but they must have concluded that that finding is not consistent with either their expectation or ours, or more importantly, other studies and experience and variance. And clearly the product's success in treating patients in pain, which is indisputable, uh, would put a lie to anybody who would say, oh, oxycodone is no better than placebo. I don't think any doctor would assert that for treating pain. Right. I should say maybe they, maybe they would say in terms of urinary incontinence, it's not effective, but for treating pain,"

So your question is given that the average blood level is the same if I'm correct. And that's a recollection, I haven't Stu seen that data for a very long time. Um, the only diff the difference in the blood level, the remarkable difference would be half as many or a third, as many peaks and valleys. And, um, to the extent that somebody was seeking the drug or enjoying that element of the drug, the, the peak effect, I would think that the drug would be less attractive, but it's a conjecture, it's not knowledge because I don't think we ever did a study that I'm aware"

Why do you think that they are more prone or less prone to addiction? I wouldn't think it would make a difference again, not based on a study, but based on a conjecture.
