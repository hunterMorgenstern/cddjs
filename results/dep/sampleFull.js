But we knew that that the word weaker did not mean less potent. We knew that the word stronger did not mean more potent. And we knew that because by this time surely anybody who was using this product recognized it was more potent. They knew it was more potent. So it's very unfortunate for your understanding as well as anybody else's understanding that, that all those issues of the stigma of morphine, of the frightening nature of morphine, of morphine being a cancer drug end of life drug, it's a very unfortunate for your understanding. And for most people's understanding that the word weaker and stronger was used. We understood what it meant.",
