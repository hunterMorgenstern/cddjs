This quote personality of oxycodone is an integral part of the quote personality. Um, this personality of oxycodone is an integral part of the personality of OxyContin. When we launched OxyContin, we init intentionally avoided a probation promotional theme that would link OxyContin to cancer pain. We specifically linked OxyContin to the oxycodone combinations with our old way new way campaign. We made sure our initial detail piece provided reps with the opportunity to sell the product for a number of different pain states. With all of this, we were still concerned that the drug would be slotted for cancer pain, and we would encounter resistance in the non-malignant pain market and says our pricing of the product was geared toward the nonmalignant market. We knew if we priced low per milligram for the higher dose cancer patient, we would be priced way too low per milligram for the standard nonmalignant pain patient, where we really wanted to make a market. We feared that the cancer pain experts would object to the two to one ratio. And that two to one ratio is the ratio of oxycodone OxyContin to morphine. Is that correct?"

And the personality of OxyContin is less threatening to them and their patients than that, of the morphine alternatives. I apologize for this unspecific term, but I feel it captures the notion that there are image related attributes that influence drug acceptance. While we might wish to see more of this product sold for cancer pain, it would be extremely dangerous at this early stage in the life of the product to tamper with this quote personality to make physicians think the drug is stronger or equal to morphine. We are better off expanding use of OxyContin in the nonmalignant pain states and waiting for hydromorphone in 1999 to relaunch into cancer pain. Why was it felt that there would be a danger?

Well, well, let's read the rest of Michael Collins, um, email dated 6, 2 97. Well, after the launch of OxyContin, paragraph three says since the non-cancer pain market is much greater than the cancer pain market, it is important that we allow this product to be positioned where it currently is in the physician's mind. If we stress the power of OxyContin versus morphine, it may help us in the smaller cancer pain market, but hurt us in the larger, larger potential non-cancer pain market. Some physicians may start positioning this product where morphine is used and wait until the pain is severe before using it.

Our approach to cancer pain will be to get physicians to use it earlier. Instead of products such as Percocet, Vicodin, or Tylenol three, the sales force can teach the oncologist the proper dose and titrate OxyContin to ensure that they stay with it as the pain increases. Now, oncologists are the cancer pain doctors, correct? That doesn't say anything about all the nonmalignant, uh, doctors, all the doctors that treat nonmalignant pain. Correct."

Contin, and that this perception has had some effect on sales.",The person does not support their points with anecdotes.,N/A,"Yeah. Sure. Well, let's go back and talk about it a little bit more then. So in the first paragraph, he says, we've discussed the issue that OxyContin is perceived by some physicians, particularly oncologists as not being as strong as MS. Contin. Although this perception has had some effect with physicians, switching to MS. Contin with the more severe cancer pain, um, it has actually had a positive effect with physicians use and non-cancer pain. So what he's saying there, if I'm reading this correctly, is that because they think it is, uh, not as strong as Ms. Cotton, when they need a strong drug for cancer pain patients, some of the physicians aren't switching to it because they don't think it's as strong and that may hurt sales a little bit there, but with the non-cancer pain where you don't want as strong a drug as an end of life, malignant cancer pain patient might need, it's actually helping ourselves that they have this misperception because they are going ahead and prescribing it because they don't think it's as strong as Ms. Cotton, that it is that what that first paragraph is saying."

We built a large part of our platform on this personality and it is to differentiate OxyContin from Duragesic. This differentiation has led to much non-malignant business marketing. This next paragraph marketing is not only about what you are it's about what you are not. We have had success beyond our expectations. That is in part due to the unique personality of OxyContin. Even as we seek to increase the use of the drug in higher doses, we should be very careful as you know, the strength of the judge drug is principally a barrier in malignant pain. If we do not want to change the image in a way, or I'm sorry, we do not want to change the image in a way that will discourage non-malignant use a barrage would be ill advised and you wrote back.
