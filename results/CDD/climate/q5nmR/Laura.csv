 The argument implies that the speaker is con-proposal.,"2. The argument states that the American public will interpret the educational campaign as a call to stop eating meat entirely, which the speaker believes is not realistic. The argument also mentions that farmers are already regulated when it comes to methane emissions, so the speaker believes that the government does not need to get involved."," i definitely do not support that second proposal about an educational campaign to cut out meat because that is going to be interpreted by the american public. and oh, we can't ever eat meat at all. so that's not going to go over too. well for farmers like me. who do raise livestock. we are very cognizant of the fact that we are a methane. emitter. we are regulated by the state of new york. if you have over three hundred head of cattle, you have to have a full nutrient plan for your farm and methane is somehow included in that plan or a little bit under that number. so i'm not super familiar, but we're very on top of these issues in farming. so don't need the government to help."
