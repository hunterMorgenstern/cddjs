They feel that farmers are already cognizant of the methane emissions produced by livestock and are regulated by the state.,," i definitely do not support that second proposal about an educational campaign to cut out meat because that is going to be interpreted by the american public. and oh, we can't ever eat meat at all. so that's not going to go over too. well for farmers like me. who do raise livestock. we are very cognizant of the fact that we are a methane. emitter. we are regulated by the state of new york. if you have over three hundred head of cattle, you have to have a full nutrient plan for your farm and methane is somehow included in that plan or a little bit under that number. so i'm not super familiar, but we're very on top of these issues in farming. so don't need the government to help."
