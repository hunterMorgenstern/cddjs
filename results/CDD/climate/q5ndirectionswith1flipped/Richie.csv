 Not enough information. The speaker does not explicitly state whether they are for or against the proposal.,"2. The speaker suggests that the government should take action to reduce methane emissions, but does not specifically mention the proposal to launch an educational campaign to encourage people to reduce their meat and dairy consumption. It is possible that the speaker is in favor of this proposal, but this is not clear from the statement."," well, i think that if the government doesn't put a standard or some limits on stuff for the start of it, i don't think anybody's going to move anywhere. there's nobody moves anywhere without they sent them, shall we say? and then the other thing with dairy farms, is there a way to recoup the efta product, if you will of these animals that you know, if you had him in a big barn or you had them somewhere that they could pick contain the methane and then burn it. if that works. i don't know. i'm not a dairy farmer seen pictures of cows. coming from new york city, but that's about it."
