 C) Pro proposal. ,"2. The speaker is in favor of the proposal to reduce methane emissions by reducing meat and dairy consumption. They argue that this would be more sustainable, and that organic meat and vegetables are a better option than feedlot meat."," one of the things that really surprises me and all sorts of discussions is they never talk about the difference between chemical free food and organic vegetables. and i think we really need. i never eat feedlot meat. i don't think anybody should eat feedlot meat or dairy because it's horrible for the animals and it's really horrible for the planet, but are organically grown vegetables and organically grown meat on much smaller farms is not unsustainable. and in fact, it does regenerate the land and i think that's a big difference. we should eat less meat than we do for sure, but it should always be sustainable, meat from small farms or wild-caught buffalo. that's restoring the prairie and like wild idea buffalo company."
