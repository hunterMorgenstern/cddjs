 The argument does not imply the speaker's stance on the proposal. ,"2. The speaker is suggesting that the methane gas being burned at the sewer plant could be used for something else, possibly heating. This is an easy solution that could be more cost effective."," i'm definitely in the big farming, agricultural, dairy area and they all reuse that to fertilizer fields, you know, the big manure pits at they're circulating that in and drying it and spreading it then and later years and that's amish farms, you know, this area. they're all doing that. but one thing i see you've met the sewer plant. they're burning a methane torch just out next to the plan, just going up in flames, which can when you're talking about earlier heating, the steam moving again. later that he could definitely be used for something that would be cost effective. so i just see a lot of people aren't even thinking about some of those things and easy solutions. try using the energy. it's being wasted."
