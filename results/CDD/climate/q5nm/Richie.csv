 The argument does not imply the speaker's stance on the proposal.,"2. The argument is about the feasibility of the proposal, specifically whether or not people would be willing to reduce their meat and dairy consumption without government intervention. The speaker suggests that without some sort of government intervention, such as a campaign or standard, people will not be willing to make the change."," well, i think that if the government doesn't put a standard or some limits on stuff for the start of it, i don't think anybody's going to move anywhere. there's nobody moves anywhere without they sent them, shall we say? and then the other thing with dairy farms, is there a way to recoup the efta product, if you will of these animals that you know, if you had him in a big barn or you had them somewhere that they could pick contain the methane and then burn it. if that works. i don't know. i'm not a dairy farmer seen pictures of cows. coming from new york city, but that's about it."
